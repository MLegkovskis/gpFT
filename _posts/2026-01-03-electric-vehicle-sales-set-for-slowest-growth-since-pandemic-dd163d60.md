**Electric‑vehicle sales are set to grow 15 % in 2026 – the slowest expansion since the COVID‑19 pandemic, yet still outpacing the broader auto market by a wide margin.** The Economist Intelligence Unit projects a 15 % year‑on‑year rise after a 21 % surge in 2025, marking the first dip below the double‑digit growth that has characterised the sector for several years. Even at this moderated pace, electric cars are expected to account for roughly one‑quarter of all new registrations worldwide, a share that dwarfs the 3‑4 % growth forecast for the global light‑vehicle market.

The 2025 figures underline the sector’s recent dynamism: global EV sales reached approximately 18.5 million units, up from 15.3 million the previous year – a 21 % increase that was five to six times faster than the overall market. September 2025 alone saw a 26 % jump, with 2.1 million vehicles changing hands, according to Motor Watt. By contrast, the 2026 outlook predicts a 15 % rise, the weakest since the pandemic‑era low of about 12 % in 2020. The slowdown reflects a convergence of market saturation in early‑adopter regions, tighter credit conditions and the gradual easing of pandemic‑driven stimulus, but it does not signal a retreat for the technology.

Industry analysts remain cautiously optimistic. The Economist Intelligence Unit, which labelled EVs “the best‑performing segment of the global auto market in 2026,” points to continued innovation in battery chemistry and manufacturing efficiencies as buffers against the deceleration. Valdez Streaty of Cox Automotive echoed this sentiment, noting that “growth moving forward … will be slower than many advocates hoped, though continued innovation in battery technology … give reason for optimism.” Such confidence is bolstered by the sector’s expanding share of new car registrations – an estimated 26.7 % in 2026 – which translates into a decisive competitive advantage over internal‑combustion vehicles that are constrained by modest 3‑4 % market growth.

The implications for manufacturers are mixed. Companies that have bet heavily on electrification stand to benefit from the entrenched market share, even as the pace of sales expansion eases. The slower growth trajectory may prompt a recalibration of capital allocation, with a greater emphasis on cost‑reduction, supply‑chain resilience and the rollout of next‑generation charging infrastructure. For traditional automakers still transitioning from fossil‑fuel models, the data underscores the urgency of accelerating their EV programmes to capture a slice of the expanding quarter‑market.

In sum, while 2026 will mark the slowest EV growth since the pandemic, the sector remains the engine of automotive expansion. A 15 % rise still eclipses the overall market’s modest gains, and a quarter‑share of new registrations signals that electric propulsion is moving from niche to norm. The coming year will test manufacturers’ ability to sustain momentum through innovation and strategic investment, even as the headline growth rate settles into a more measured rhythm.
