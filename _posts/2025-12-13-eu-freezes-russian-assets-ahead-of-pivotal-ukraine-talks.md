**The European Union has voted to immobilise roughly €210 billion of Russian sovereign assets indefinitely, removing the need for six‑monthly renewals and clearing the way for a proposed €165 billion “reparations loan” to Ukraine ahead of high‑stakes talks on the war’s next phase.**  

## Scope of the freeze  

On 12 December 2025 EU leaders adopted a qualified‑majority decision to keep Russian central‑bank holdings frozen for as long as required. The assets, estimated at €210 billion ($246 billion), are largely parked with Euroclear in Belgium – €185 billion of the total is recorded at the clearing house. By converting the temporary sanctions renewal into a permanent immobilisation, the bloc eliminates the risk that Hungary or Slovakia, both perceived as Moscow‑friendly, could block future extensions and force a return of the funds to Russia.  

## Financial mechanics and the Ukraine loan  

The immobilised cash is earmarked to underpin a multi‑year loan to Kyiv. EU officials have outlined a package of up to €165 billion, to be disbursed across 2026‑27, covering both military procurement and civilian reconstruction. Interest generated by the frozen assets – roughly €3 billion a year – would be earmarked to service the loan, while the principal would remain untouched until Russia pays reparations deemed sufficient by the EU.  

## Political backdrop  

The decision arrives as the EU prepares for a pivotal summit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on 18 December, where the scope of future assistance and the conditions for a post‑war settlement will be debated. EU Council President Antonio Costa hailed the move as a fulfilment of the Union’s “commitment to immobilise Russian assets until the war ends and damages are compensated.”  

## Reactions from Moscow and dissenting members  

Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, warned that the indefinite freeze could cause “irreparable damage to the Union” and pledged to pursue legal avenues to restore what he described as a lawful state of affairs. Russia’s central bank denounced the plan as “illegal, contrary to international law” and announced a lawsuit against Euroclear in a Moscow court, alleging that the seizure jeopardises its ability to manage the funds.  

## Legal and economic implications  

The EU’s use of Article 122 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union marks an unprecedented legal workaround, allowing the Commission to retain emergency powers over the assets without a full Council vote each six months. Analysts note that while the move strengthens the EU’s bargaining position, it also raises complex questions about sovereign‑immunity precedent and the potential impact on the euro‑area’s financial stability.  

## Outlook  

With the asset freeze now permanent, the EU’s next step is to finalise the loan framework and secure Belgium’s backing for any interest‑income transfers. The forthcoming Brussels summit will test whether the financial lever can translate into tangible support for Ukraine and further isolate Moscow as the conflict enters its fifth year.
