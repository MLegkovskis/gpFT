**EU Freezes Russian Assets Ahead of Pivotal Ukraine Talks**
The European Union has frozen approximately €210 billion (£185 billion) of Russian sovereign assets, in a move that is expected to have significant implications for the Russian economy and upcoming Ukraine talks. This decision, made on 12 December 2025, is a major escalation of the EU's economic sanctions against Russia, and is likely to have far-reaching consequences for the country's GDP and export-related activities.

According to reports, the frozen assets are valued at around €210 billion, with approximately €185 billion held in Belgium's Euroclear clearing house. The EU plans to use the interest income from these assets to fund a "reparations loan" to Ukraine, with up to €165 billion available for drawdown. This move is seen as a significant blow to the Russian economy, with analysts estimating that it will reduce Russia's GDP by around 1%, equivalent to approximately $25 billion.

The legal mechanism used to freeze the assets is Article 122 of the EU Treaty, which allows for emergency powers to be invoked in exceptional circumstances. This decision was made through a qualified-majority vote of the European Council, and is seen as a major victory for EU leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen, who welcomed the decision as a key step in supporting Ukraine.

The freeze is expected to have both short-term and long-term impacts on the Russian economy. In the short term, the loss of interest income from the frozen assets is expected to result in a fiscal hit of around €2-3 billion per year, equivalent to approximately 0.1% of GDP. This will limit the Russian government's ability to fund budget deficits and support the private sector. In the long term, the freeze is expected to create a structural drag on growth, as Russia's ability to refinance sovereign debt and support its "shadow fleet" of oil tankers is severely curtailed.

As noted by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-sanctions-could-shave-1-russias-gdp-analysts-say-2024-05-15/), the freeze could shave up to 1% off Russia's GDP, with significant implications for the country's economic growth. The [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-use-russias-frozen-assets) also notes that the freeze will limit Russia's ability to access foreign-currency financing, further depressing export-related growth.

In response to the decision, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has condemned the EU's actions, describing them as a "systematic rape of European law". However, EU leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen, have welcomed the decision, with von der Leyen stating that "I welcome the decision of the Council on our proposal to continue the immobilisation of Russian sovereign assets".
