**EU Freezes Russian Assets Ahead of Pivotal Ukraine Talks**
The European Union has **indefinitely frozen Russian assets** worth approximately **€210 billion** (≈ $246 billion) in a move designed to increase pressure on Moscow and provide financial support to Ukraine. This decision, made on **12 December 2025**, removes the previous six-month renewal requirement, effectively giving the EU control over the frozen assets until Russia ends its war of aggression and pays reparations.

The frozen assets, primarily held in the Belgian clearing house Euroclear, are part of a **global pool of approximately €300 billion** in immobilized Russian sovereign assets. According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/eu-set-indefinitely-freeze-russian-assets-removing-obstacle-ukraine-loan-2025-12-12/), the EU's decision aims to "immobilise 210 billion euros ($246 billion) worth of Russian sovereign assets for as long as needed."

This move is expected to have significant implications for Russia's economy, with the loss of **€210 billion** in liquid sovereign reserves removing a major source of financing for the Russian state. The **annual profit stream** from these reserves, estimated at **€3 billion**, will also be denied to Moscow. As noted by the [Economics Observatory](https://www.economicsobservatory.com/sanctions-effectiveness-what-lessons-three-years-into-the-war-on-ukraine), Russia's GDP is now 10-12% below pre-invasion trends, with a contraction of -2.1% in 2022.

The EU's decision to freeze Russian assets is part of a broader effort to support Ukraine and increase pressure on Russia. The frozen assets are intended to underwrite a **large-scale loan for Ukraine**, estimated at **€165 billion**, which will cover its budgetary and military shortfalls for the next two years. As stated by [Ursula von der Leyen](https://www.politico.eu/article/japan-eu-frozen-russian-assets-ukraine-loan-g7/), the European Commission President, "We are sending a strong signal to Russia that as long as this brutal war of aggression continues, Russia's costs will continue to rise."

In contrast to the 2014 EU sanctions following the annexation of Crimea, the current move represents a **qualitative leap** in terms of scale, target, and purpose. The 2014 sanctions were limited, time-bound, and focused on individuals, whereas the current freeze is indefinite, bloc-wide, and aimed at immobilizing sovereign wealth. As noted by [Emmanuel Macron](https://kyivindependent.com/exclusive-eu-leaders-say-that-they-not-us-will-decide-on-frozen-russian-assets/), the President of France, "Anything on frozen assets should be at our hands," emphasizing the EU's autonomy over the assets and its commitment to supporting Ukraine.
