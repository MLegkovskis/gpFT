**The European Union has moved to immobilise roughly €210 billion of Russian sovereign assets – the bulk of which sits in the Belgian clearing house Euroclear – as it prepares for high‑stakes talks with Kyiv on security, financing and the prospect of Ukraine’s EU accession.**  

## Scope of the freeze  

- **Value:** €210 billion (≈ $246 billion) of Russian central‑bank and state‑owned assets are now frozen indefinitely, removing the six‑monthly renewal requirement that previously constrained the bloc.  
- **Location:** About €185 billion is held at Euroclear; a further €25 billion is dispersed across banks in France, Belgium, Cyprus and Germany.  
- **Legal basis:** The decision was taken by qualified‑majority vote of the 27 member states under the EU’s emergency‑powers framework, a move championed by Belgium to secure its support for the next phase of the Ukraine financing plan.  

## Why the timing matters  

The freeze precedes a summit scheduled for early December 2025, where EU leaders will negotiate a **€165 billion loan** for Ukraine covering military and civilian budget needs in 2026‑27. The loan is to be backed by the immobilised Russian assets, with repayment contingent on the lifting of sanctions and the eventual payment of war reparations by Moscow.  

## Financial mechanics  

- **Interest earnings:** Euroclear reports that the frozen portfolio generated €3.9 billion in interest in 2024, of which €2.5 billion has already been transferred to the G7‑backed Ukraine loan facility.  
- **Potential exposure:** Germany has signalled a willingness to guarantee up to €52 billion of the loan, while Hungary and Slovakia remain opposed, fearing a future liability should the assets be returned to Russia.  
- **Reparations clause:** The EU’s proposal stipulates that Ukraine will only begin repayment once Russia complies with a reparations framework agreed by the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund.  

## Wider context  

The EU’s action aligns with parallel measures by the G7, which together have immobilised roughly €260 billion of Russian reserves worldwide. The collective effort aims to deny Moscow access to hard currency while channeling the proceeds into Ukraine’s reconstruction and defence.  

## Political implications  

- **EU cohesion:** By making the freeze indefinite, Brussels sidesteps the risk of vetoes from member states with closer ties to Moscow, notably Hungary and Slovakia.  
- **Signal to Russia:** The move underscores the EU’s resolve to maintain economic pressure without resorting to outright confiscation, a stance that seeks to avoid escalation while keeping diplomatic channels open for a negotiated settlement.  

The forthcoming EU‑Ukraine talks will test whether the frozen assets can be transformed into a sustainable financing instrument for Kyiv, or whether internal dissent within the bloc will blunt the initiative’s impact.
