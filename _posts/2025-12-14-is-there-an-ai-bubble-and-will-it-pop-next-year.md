**Is there an AI bubble and will it pop next year?**
The technology world is abuzz with the notion that the current artificial intelligence (AI) investment frenzy is mirroring the infamous dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Indeed, the numbers are striking: in 2024, US AI venture capital reached $109.1 billion, nearly 12 times the amount invested in China and 24 times that in the UK, according to [Stanford HAI](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report). This explosion in funding has led many to wonder if an AI bubble is forming and whether it will eventually pop.

The comparison to the dot-com era is not unfounded. Both periods have seen explosive, sector-wide capital inflows, with a dominant share of venture capital (VC) going to a single technology sector - internet in the late 1990s and AI today. In fact, AI funding has already reached the same order of magnitude as the dot-com peak, albeit in a compressed timeframe. The year-over-year growth in AI deals is also noteworthy, with a 47% increase in Q3 2025, according to [Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2025/09/ai-deals-in-2025-key-trends-in-ma-private-equity-and-venture-capital).

However, there are key differences between the two periods. Today's AI investors appear more focused on profitability and traction, rather than mere hype. As Morgan Lewis analysts note, investors are "prioritising startups that demonstrate traction in enterprise adoption and integration over pure hype." This shift in focus is reflected in the fact that many AI-related firms have already shown profitability, such as Nvidia's $26 billion FY-24 profit. Additionally, the regulatory environment is far more stringent, with 59 new AI-related rules introduced in 2024, according to [Stanford HAI](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report).

The capital-expenditure (CapEx) commitments in the AI sector are also worth noting. With projected 2025 AI-related CapEx reaching $400 billion, according to [Lord Abbett](https://www.lordabbett.com/en-us/financial-advisor/insights/investment-objectives/2025/2026-investment-outlook-riding-the-tailwinds.html), the sector is witnessing an unprecedented level of investment in infrastructure. While this could drive growth, it also raises the risk of a significant correction if demand stalls.

So, will the AI bubble pop in 2025-2026? While the similarities between the dot-com era and the current AI investment frenzy are striking, the differences - particularly the focus on profitability and regulation - reduce the probability of a pure speculative bubble. Nevertheless, the concentration of capital, massive CapEx commitments, and high valuation multiples mean a significant correction is still plausible. Investors should therefore closely monitor earnings trends, CapEx utilization, and regulatory developments to gauge whether the AI rally is transitioning from hype to sustainable growth.
