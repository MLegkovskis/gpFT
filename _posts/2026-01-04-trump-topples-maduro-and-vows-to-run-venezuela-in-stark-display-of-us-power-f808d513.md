**Trump’s forces seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on 3 January, flying the deposed leader to New York and announcing that the United States would “run” the country until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” could be arranged – a stark demonstration of American power that has reverberated through capitals, markets and the federal budget.** 

The operation, dubbed **Operation Absolute Resolve**, is projected to cost roughly **$12 billion**, a figure that sits near the centre of a $10‑$15 billion range cited by analysts. The Treasury plans to absorb the expense primarily through the defence discretionary budget, adding an extra $1.8 billion to the emergency contingency line in the FY 2026 request. In practice, the $12 billion lifts the defence outlay from $845 billion to about $857 billion – a 1.4 % increase – while the overall federal deficit is expected to swell by only $0.5 billion, roughly 0.3 % of the $1.6 trillion projected shortfall. Anticipated oil royalties of $2 billion from seized Venezuelan assets will partially offset the outlay, leaving the debt‑to‑GDP ratio nudged from 106 % to 106.2 % by year‑end.

The diplomatic fallout has been swift and uniformly cautious. The European Union’s Commission called for immediate de‑escalation and respect for the United Nations Charter, while individual EU members echoed the sentiment: Denmark’s foreign minister warned of the need for dialogue, France’s president condemned any unilateral breach of sovereignty, Germany’s chancellor urged compliance with international law, and the United Kingdom’s foreign secretary expressed “great concern” and called for restraint. Russia’s foreign ministry labelled the capture a “grave violation of sovereignty and international law” that threatens regional stability, and China’s foreign ministry, though offering no direct quotation, signalled that the issue should be resolved through dialogue and respect for state sovereignty. Latin‑American leaders, from Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to Mexico’s senior officials, denounced the move as an imperialist grab for oil, while Cuba’s president framed it as another episode of U.S. aggression.

Financial markets reacted within hours, reflecting the classic risk‑premium response to a sudden geopolitical shock in a major oil‑producing nation. Brent crude rose about 2.1 % to $84 per barrel, and U.S. WTI climbed 1.8 % to $80 per barrel, as traders priced in the possibility of a rapid re‑allocation of Venezuela’s 300 billion‑barrel reserves and the spectre of secondary sanctions on any future exports. Natural‑gas futures on NYMEX gained 1.4 % to $3.12 per MMBtu, driven by speculation that U.S. control could eventually unlock Venezuela’s gas‑rich fields. Base‑metal indices on the LME edged up 0.6 %, while gold, the traditional safe‑haven, rose 0.9 % to $2,150 an ounce. The modest uplift across commodities underscores heightened uncertainty and a shift toward hard assets as investors hedge against further instability.

In sum, the United States has launched a costly, constitutionally contentious intervention that will be financed largely within existing defence appropriations and will have a negligible effect on the overall federal deficit. The operation has provoked a chorus of diplomatic censure, particularly from the EU, Russia and China, and has already nudged global oil prices higher while lifting broader commodity markets. Whether the promised “run” of Venezuela will translate into a stable, revenue‑generating administration remains to be seen, but the immediate fiscal, diplomatic and market reverberations are already evident.
