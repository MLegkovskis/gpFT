**The consensus among Beijing’s top economists is that China’s export‑ and investment‑driven engine is losing steam, and a shift toward consumption‑led, high‑quality growth is now a policy imperative.** In a November 2024 address to the National People’s Congress, People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng warned that “a more relaxed monetary‑policy environment in 2025” is needed to support “new‑quality productivity development” and to ensure that regulatory measures promote “high‑quality growth”. The same message echoed in the Finance Ministry’s 2025 budget, which acknowledged that the “existing growth model, heavily reliant on investment and exports, faces mounting constraints”. Both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, in December 2025, called for deeper structural reforms – especially in the social‑protection system and business‑environment predictability – to underpin a sustainable, domestic‑demand‑driven recovery.

The policy shift is reflected in concrete monetary and fiscal levers. The PBOC plans to trim the reserve‑requirement ratio to 11.5 % and lower the benchmark loan rate to 3.45 %, complementing “extraordinary counter‑cyclical adjustments” such as open‑market purchases of government bonds. At the same time, the Finance Ministry’s budget earmarks a fiscal impulse of roughly 1.6 % of GDP for 2025, directed at infrastructure, subsidies and social‑protection spending, while household‑targeted stimulus is slated at about 0.5 % of GDP. These measures aim to raise the household income share of GDP, broaden the tax base for small‑and‑medium enterprises and tighten local‑government “special‑bond” issuance to rein in debt, which stood at an estimated 280 % of GDP in 2024.

The urgency of reform is underscored by the macro‑economic backdrop. While China’s projected real GDP growth of 5 % for 2025 marks a modest decline from the 5.2 % recorded in late 2024, it remains above the mid‑2 % range that has characterised the United States over the past decade. In the United States, the second‑quarter 2025 real GDP growth of 3.8 % – a short‑term spike – masks a full‑year forecast of only about 1.9 %, returning the economy to the “mid‑2 %” band that has persisted since 2015. Over the 2015‑2025 period, U.S. inflation‑adjusted output rose 28 %, an average of roughly 2.5 % per year, far slower than the double‑digit expansions recorded by emerging markets such as China and India. The U.S. experience illustrates how an economy that once relied on post‑pandemic stimulus can settle back into modest growth once the initial demand surge fades, a pattern that Chinese policymakers are keen to avoid.

Both external advisers and domestic officials converge on the view that structural headwinds – an ageing population, high debt levels and slowing productivity – threaten the durability of the traditional export‑led model. The IMF’s December 2025 press release raised China’s growth forecast to 5 % but warned that without “deeper structural reforms” the model will become “increasingly hard to sustain”. The World Bank’s June 2025 economic update echoed this sentiment, stressing that “advancing structural reforms of the social‑protection system” and creating a “more predictable environment for businesses” are essential to boost confidence and lay the groundwork for resilient growth.

In practice, the policy mix being deployed seeks to balance short‑term stimulus with long‑term reform. Monetary easing is intended to lower financing costs for “high‑quality” projects, while green‑finance tools are being expanded to align credit with the 2060 carbon‑neutrality goal. Fiscal measures are being redirected from heavy infrastructure spending toward health, education and social services, thereby raising household disposable income and stimulating consumption. If these adjustments succeed, China could transition to a growth model that mirrors the United States’ recent trajectory: lower‑single‑digit annual expansions supported by a more diversified demand base, rather than the high‑growth, export‑centric engine of the past decade.

The coming years will test whether China can recalibrate its growth engine without triggering a slowdown that mirrors the United States’ return to the mid‑2 % range. The policy consensus is clear: without structural reforms, the current model is indeed becoming “harder to sustain”.
