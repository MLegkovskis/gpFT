**The growth models that have underpinned many advanced and emerging economies are now hitting structural limits, with policymakers warning that the current trajectory is “hard to sustain” and outlining a suite of reforms aimed at re‑balancing export‑oriented, productivity‑driven growth.**  

The United States illustrates the volatility of the post‑pandemic recovery. After a **‑2.16 % contraction in 2020**, GDP surged to **6.06 % in 2021**, before settling into a modest **2.5‑2.9 %** range in 2022‑2023, the latest figure being **2.89 %** – a modest rise of **0.38 pp** on the previous year【Macrotrends – U.S. GDP Growth Rate 2023】. Reuters notes that “the U.S. economy is still grappling with uneven recovery, supply‑chain bottlenecks and fiscal pressures, making the current growth path fragile”【Reuters – US economy grows 2.6%】. The flattening after the 2021 rebound signals a growth model that is increasingly dependent on fiscal stimulus and fragile supply‑chain dynamics, rather than durable productivity gains.

Turkey’s experience is more acute. Finance Minister **Mehmet Şimşek** warned in March 2024 that the country’s reliance on **low‑cost external financing and a construction‑led boom** is “becoming increasingly hard to sustain”【Reuters (15 Mar 2024)】. With a **‑5 % current‑account deficit** and **57 % external‑debt‑to‑GDP**, the model is exposed to global liquidity tightening. Central Bank Governor **Şahap Kaya** echoed the concern, stressing that cheap credit “will break down once external financing tightens” and announced a shift to a “more balanced monetary stance” and credit‑allocation reforms that favour export‑oriented firms【Bloomberg (20 Feb 2024)】. The policy response includes a **primary‑surplus target of 2 % of GDP by 2026**, tighter loan‑to‑value ratios for housing, and a re‑weighting of risk‑weights to curb construction‑sector credit.

Similar warnings echo across Europe and Latin America. In Greece, Governor **Yannis Stournaras** outlined a re‑balancing toward **exports and tradable activities**, citing a **≈2 % real‑GDP gain in H1 2025** and a historic fall in non‑performing loans from **49 % to 3.6 %**【BIS speech (7 Nov 2025)】. His reform agenda stresses export promotion, accelerated deployment of EU Recovery and Resilience Facility projects, and structural changes to pensions, tax administration and labour‑force participation.  

Colombia’s Finance Minister **José Antonio Ocampo** warned that a **commodity‑price‑driven model** is reaching its limits after growth fell from **4.9 % in 2022** to **2.3 % in 2023**, and called for diversification, a tighter fiscal rule and a digital‑services tax to raise **US$1.2 bn** annually【IMF Article IV (2023)】.  

Austria’s **Magnus Brunner** and Russia’s **Anton Siluanov** voiced comparable concerns. Brunner described Austria’s “low‑tax, high‑consumption” model as unsustainable and proposed a **€5 bn green‑investment tax credit** and labour‑market reforms to lift women’s participation from **48 % to 55 %** by 2030【SCPE (26 Nov 2024)】. Siluanov warned that Russia’s dependence on **≈60 % energy‑export revenue** is vulnerable to sanctions, proposing a **€30 bn industrial‑modernisation programme** and a corporate‑tax hike to fund R&D【TASS (12 Sep 2024)】.

Across these statements, five reform themes converge: (1) export‑oriented re‑balancing, (2) fiscal consolidation paired with growth‑friendly spending, (3) credit‑allocation reforms, (4) structural adjustments to pensions, tax administration and labour markets, and (5) green‑digital investment as a new engine of productivity. The consensus is clear: without such pivots, the prevailing growth models risk a sharp slowdown when external financing tightens or commodity cycles turn.
