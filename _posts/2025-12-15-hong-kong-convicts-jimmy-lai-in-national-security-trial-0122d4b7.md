**Hong Kong convicts Jimmy Lai in national security trial**

The three‑judge panel at West Kowloon Law Courts handed former *Apple Daily* founder Jimmy Lai a guilty verdict on 15 December 2025, finding him guilty of two counts of “conspiracy to collude with foreign forces” under the National Security Law and one count of “conspiracy to publish seditious articles” under the colonial‑era Sedition Ordinance. The judgment, delivered by Judges Alex Lee, Esther Toh and Susana D’Almada Remedios, carries a potential life sentence and marks the first time the National Security Law has been used to imprison a media proprietor. The decision has been described by press‑freedom watchdogs as the “crushing of the last major symbol of independent journalism in Hong Kong”.

Lai’s conviction is the latest flashpoint in a 28‑year erosion of the freedoms promised at the 1997 handover. The Sino‑British Joint Declaration and Hong Kong’s Basic Law guaranteed “freedom of speech, of the press and of publication” for fifty years, and the early post‑handover period saw a vibrant media landscape – more than 300 newspapers and 15 television channels, with the territory ranked 18th in the 2002 Reporters Without Borders (RSF) World Press Freedom Index. However, the 2003 anti‑Article 23 protests signalled the first large‑scale public push‑back against Beijing‑driven security legislation, foreshadowing a gradual tightening of the media environment.

From 2004 to 2014, pro‑Beijing ownership of major outlets such as the *South China Morning Post* and RTHK increased, prompting a rise in self‑censorship and a loss of market share for independent voices. The 2014 Umbrella Movement, which drew roughly one million participants, demonstrated a growing willingness to challenge the political system, but journalists covering the protests began to face harassment. The 2019 anti‑extradition bill protests, which saw up to two million demonstrators on 9 June, brought *Apple Daily* and *Stand News* into the spotlight for their live coverage, and police raids on newsrooms followed.

The watershed moment arrived on 30 June 2020 when Beijing imposed the National Security Law (NSL), criminalising secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. Within weeks, Lai was arrested on 17 August 2020, becoming the first high‑profile media figure targeted under the new statute. The same year, *Apple Daily* was forced to shut down after police raids and the freezing of its assets, depriving more than a million daily readers of a major independent voice. *Stand News* met a similar fate on 23 December 2021, with its editors arrested under the NSL. Between 2020 and 2024, more than five smaller independent sites were shuttered, and over thirty journalists and editors were charged, creating a climate of self‑censorship that drove Hong Kong’s RSF ranking from 18th in 2002 to 140th in May 2025 – the lowest ever for the city.

Lai’s pre‑trial detention exceeded 1 800 days, much of it in solitary confinement, underscoring the personal cost of dissent. The conviction has been condemned by international bodies: Reporters Without Borders called the verdict “trumped‑up” and a “stark illustration of how the NSL is being used to criminalise core journalistic functions”. The Committee to Protect Journalists echoed the sentiment, while the Hong Kong Journalists Association warned that the space for independent reporting has been reduced to a “red zone” where any criticism can be labelled a security threat.

The legal finality of Lai’s sentencing transforms the NSL from a looming threat into an enforceable weapon against press freedom. It signals to remaining independent outlets that the cost of defiance now includes the prospect of life imprisonment. For Hong Kong’s business community, the verdict deepens concerns about the rule of law and the predictability of the regulatory environment, potentially deterring foreign investment and straining diplomatic ties with Western economies that have long championed the city’s autonomy.

In sum, Jimmy Lai’s conviction is not an isolated case but the culmination of a systematic trajectory that began with a constitutional promise of liberty, progressed through incremental legal constraints, and now culminates in the decisive, punitive application of the National Security Law. The verdict marks a watershed moment, sealing the end of an era for Hong Kong’s independent press and reshaping the territory’s political and economic landscape for years to come.
