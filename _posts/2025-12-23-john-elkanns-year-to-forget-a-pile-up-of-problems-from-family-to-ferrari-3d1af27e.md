**John Elkann’s “year to forget” sees Ferrari shares tumble almost 12 % as family, regulatory and strategic pressures converge, casting a shadow over the Agnelli empire.** 
The iconic Italian marque closed 23 December 2025 at $373.65, down from $424.38 a year earlier – an 11.95 % slide that mirrors a broader malaise across Exor’s holdings. A €175 million tax settlement with Italy’s Revenue Agency, a pending Stellantis CEO appointment, tightening EU emissions rules and fierce competition from Chinese manufacturers have combined to make 2025 a crucible for the heir to Gianni Agnelli’s legacy.

The tax dispute, resolved on 7 July 2025, forced the Elkann siblings to part with €175 million to settle an inheritance case that had lingered for years. While the payment was a one‑off, it underscored lingering governance frictions within the family, echoing the inheritance turmoil that plagued Gianni Agnelli’s era. At the same time, Exor pledged €2 billion for new vehicle production in Italy, a move designed to placate domestic stakeholders but one that adds to the capital‑intensive demands on the group’s balance sheet.

Regulatory headwinds have intensified. The European Union’s 2035 CO₂ target remains under negotiation, and Elkann has repeatedly warned that “the discussion with Brussels is still open regarding 2035.” Compliance costs are set to rise, squeezing margins at Stellantis and Ferrari alike. Across the Atlantic, U.S. import duties have shaved €1.3 billion from Stellantis’s profit forecast, a reminder that trade policy continues to be a decisive factor for the group’s earnings.

Strategically, the group’s foray into China through a partnership with Leapmotor, launched in 2021, now yields a 30 % year‑on‑year sales increase. Yet the Chinese market’s volatility and the rise of domestic EV rivals keep pressure on Ferrari’s premium positioning. The 2025 commercial agreement with Ferrari, worth €80 million with an optional €120 million extension, reflects a cautious approach to monetising the brand amid uncertain demand.

Leadership transition adds another layer of complexity. A new Stellantis chief executive is slated for mid‑2025, with Elkann insisting the search must identify a candidate with “strong leadership capability and great cultural dexterity.” The appointment will determine how effectively the conglomerate navigates the twin challenges of electrification and market fragmentation.

The current turmoil invites comparison with Gianni Agnelli’s early‑2000s crisis. Back then, Fiat required a €3 billion bank bailout, its shares fell roughly 80 % from the 1998 peak, and the family fortune halved from $5 billion to $2.3 billion. Personal tragedy compounded the financial strain: the suicide of son Edoardo in 2000, Gianni’s death in January 2003 and brother Umberto’s passing in 2004. The Agnelli dynasty also grappled with a 20 % stake sale to General Motors in 2000, a partnership intended to inject capital but which underscored the group’s vulnerability.

Both eras feature inheritance‑related disputes and leadership hand‑overs under duress, yet the nature of the crises diverges. Gianni’s challenges threatened the very survival of Fiat, a single‑industry behemoth teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. Elkann, by contrast, steers a diversified empire—Stellantis, Ferrari, media and finance assets—where the pressures are strategic, regulatory and governance‑focused rather than existential. The 2025 tax settlement, while sizeable, is a fraction of the €2 billion Italian investment and does not imperil the group’s liquidity in the way the 2002‑03 bailout did for Fiat.

In sum, John Elkann’s “year to forget” is defined by a confluence of legal, fiscal and market forces that have dented investor confidence, as reflected in Ferrari’s near‑12 % share decline. The episode serves as a modern echo of the Agnelli family’s historic resilience, but the stakes now span a broader, more complex portfolio that must adapt to a rapidly evolving automotive landscape.
