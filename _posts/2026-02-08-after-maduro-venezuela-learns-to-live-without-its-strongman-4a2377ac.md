### After Maduro: Venezuela learns to live without its strongman
The capture of President Nicolás Maduro by U.S. special-operations forces in early January 2026 has significant implications for Venezuela and the region. The country is at a critical juncture, with potential outcomes including a fragile but functional state, a fragmented conflict zone, or a renewed authoritarian regime.

The migration dynamics are also expected to shift, with approximately 6.8 million Venezuelans having left the country since 2014. The oil production shock, with crude-oil output falling from approximately 1 million bpd to 300 k bpd in 2025, will also have a significant impact on the country's economy and regional energy markets.

International organizations and foreign governments will play a crucial role in shaping Venezuela's post-Maduro political landscape. The United Nations, Organization of American States, European Union, United States, Russia, and China will all have a significant influence on the country's future trajectory.

The United States will continue to use coercive tools, such as sanctions, to force a power vacuum, while also offering incentives for a transitional authority to commit to free elections and anti-corruption reforms. Russia will act as a counter-balance to U.S. pressure, guaranteeing security-sector loyalty to a Maduro-aligned faction and using energy-credit leverage to keep the oil sector under its influence.

China's financial backing will give the post-Maduro regime fiscal breathing room, but it also gives Beijing leverage to demand a politically neutral environment for its projects, discouraging rapid regime change. The heterogeneous regional stance will produce a 'patchwork' of diplomatic recognition, affecting everything from refugee-policy coordination to the willingness of neighboring states to host peace talks.
