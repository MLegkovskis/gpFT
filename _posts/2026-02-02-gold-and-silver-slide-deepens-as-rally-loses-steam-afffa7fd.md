# Gold and Silver Prices Plummet After Record Rally
The prices of gold and silver have experienced a significant decline, with gold falling from $5,595/oz to $4,900/oz, a 12% drop, and silver falling from $121/oz to $85/oz, a 30-36% plunge. This downturn comes after a record rally, with gold rising 30% and silver surging 70% year-to-date.
## Key Factors Contributing to the Decline
Several factors have contributed to the decline in gold and silver prices, including:
* Massive profit-taking after a record rally
* A stronger US dollar and hawkish Fed expectations, particularly with the nomination of Kevin Warsh as Fed Chair
* Technical over-boughtness, with gold's Relative Strength Index (RSI) hitting 90 and silver's RSI reaching 93.86
* Easing of safe-haven demand as geopolitical tensions have softened
* A market-wide sell-off in related assets, including US equity indices and precious-metal ETFs
## Impact on the Overall Stock Market and GDP
The downturn in gold and silver prices has had a significant impact on the overall stock market, with the S&P 500 falling 1.2% and the Dow Jones falling 0.9%. The US GDP Q1-2026 forecast has been trimmed from 2.4% to 2.1%, citing reduced consumer confidence and weaker investment spending. The sell-off has also led to a rise in market volatility, with the VIX jumping to 22.3.
