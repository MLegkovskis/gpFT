**Iran’s streets have once again become a flashpoint for global diplomacy, as Western capitals denounce a violent crackdown while Moscow, Beijing and Ankara rally behind Tehran’s claim of sovereign self‑defence.** Within the first two weeks of January 2026, a chorus of statements from the United States, the European Union and a host of other governments laid bare a starkly divided international response to the regime’s renewed repression of demonstrators demanding fundamental freedoms.

The United States moved swiftly. Senators Rick Scott and Pete Ricketts publicly urged “more pressure on Tehran” and praised Iranians for “calling for an end to the abusive Iranian dictatorship”. A video released on 13 January featured former President Donald Trump warning of “very strong options” should the regime kill protesters. The tone was unequivocal: the crackdown warranted heightened diplomatic, and potentially military, pressure.

Across the continent, the European Union echoed a similar condemnation. In an interview on 11 January, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen declared that the EU “condemns the Iranian regime’s crackdown and calls for the immediate release of all imprisoned demonstrators”, pledging “full” solidarity with the Iranian people. Individual EU members added their voices: President Emmanuel Macron denounced “state violence” against women and men, Chancellor Olaf Scholz labelled a government that survives “only through violence” as “effectively finished”, and Spain’s foreign ministry summoned Iran’s ambassador to protest “mass arrests and lethal force”.

Japan’s foreign ministry, in a statement on 13 January, urged an end to the violence and a swift settlement of the crisis, while the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed “deep alarm” over reports of lethal force and mass arrests. Amnesty International’s Secretary‑General Agnès Callamard called for urgent diplomatic action and warned of impunity, hinting at possible legal avenues such as ICC referral or universal jurisdiction.

In stark contrast, three non‑Western powers defended Tehran. Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu blamed “Israel’s intelligence services” for the unrest, portraying the protests as foreign‑engineered. Russia’s foreign ministry accused unnamed outside forces of attempting to destabilise Iran and pledged “stand with Tehran”. China’s foreign ministry warned against foreign interference, insisting that “national sovereignty must be respected”. These statements framed the protests as an external plot, reinforcing Tehran’s narrative of defending national integrity.

The diplomatic split is mirrored on the streets of the world’s capitals. Demonstrations in London, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo and New York, each drawing thousands, underscored a grassroots outcry that adds pressure on governments to adopt firmer stances. Meanwhile, an internet blackout of roughly 60 hours, reported by DW News on 11 January, highlighted the regime’s attempt to contain the unrest.

Overall, the early‑January chorus reveals a world divided between condemnation of Iran’s heavy‑handed response and defence of its sovereign right to maintain order. Western democracies have framed the protests as a fight for freedom, threatening sanctions and diplomatic isolation, whereas Russia, China and Turkey have rallied behind Tehran, accusing external actors of meddling. The United Nations and Amnesty International’s alarm signals a possible escalation toward international legal scrutiny. As the situation evolves, the balance of diplomatic pressure versus sovereign defence will shape Iran’s political trajectory and the broader geopolitical contest over human rights versus non‑intervention.
