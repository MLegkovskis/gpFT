**Swiss dealmaking has exploded, with 2025 M&A activity up 465 % year‑to‑date to US $16.7 billion and a full‑year total of US $163 billion – the highest ever recorded for the country – despite a Swiss franc that has appreciated 14 % against the dollar and is 39 % stronger than the tariff‑adjusted export benchmark.** 

The surge is being powered primarily by private‑equity firms, most notably Advent International’s CHF 1.05 billion (≈ US $1.3 billion) acquisition of Zurich‑listed chipmaker U‑blox Holding AG. In the first half of the year, Swiss companies have been the target of 223 deals, generating US $27.3 billion, a pace that dwarfs the activity seen during the 2011 euro‑zone crisis when the franc’s appreciation forced the SNB to impose a minimum‑exchange‑rate floor. 

In 2011, the franc rose to CHF 1.20 per euro, its strongest level since 2007, prompting intervention that “squeezed exporters and threatened deflation”. M&A volumes stalled, with total deal value hovering around US $7 billion – roughly one‑twentieth of the 2025 total – and only about 120 deals recorded for the year. By contrast, the current environment shows no comparable policy response; the market has simply absorbed the strong currency, buoyed by foreign investors seeking Swiss assets despite higher price tags. 

Bankers and industry observers point to the resilience of Switzerland’s high‑tech and life‑science sectors as a key catalyst. The U‑blox transaction exemplifies confidence in the country’s innovation pipeline, while the broader private‑equity push reflects a belief that Swiss companies remain attractive targets for cross‑border capital. The Bloomberg data underscores this narrative, noting that “the volume of takeovers targeting Swiss companies has jumped 465 % to $16.7 billion so far this year”. 

The contrast with 2011 is stark. Back then, the SNB’s floor at 1.20 CHF/EUR was intended to protect exporters, yet it coincided with a contraction in deal activity. Today, the franc’s strength is a macro‑headwind that has not dampened M&A enthusiasm. Instead, the market appears to be driven by a combination of abundant private‑equity funds, a stable regulatory framework, and the perception that Swiss firms offer high‑quality assets with resilient cash flows. 

Analysts warn that the current boom may be sensitive to further currency appreciation or a shift in global risk appetite, but the sheer scale of the 2025 surge suggests a structural shift. The number of deals and the total value are both more than double the figures from the previous peak in 2012, indicating that the strong franc is no longer the decisive barrier it once was. 

Looking ahead, the trajectory of Swiss M&A will likely hinge on whether private‑equity capital continues to flow and whether the franc’s strength stabilises. For now, the data paints a picture of a market that has turned a traditional weakness into a catalyst for unprecedented dealmaking activity.
