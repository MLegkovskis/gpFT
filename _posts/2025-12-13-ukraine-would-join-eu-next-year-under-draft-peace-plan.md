**Ukraine would join EU next year under draft peace plan**
The European Union has welcomed a draft peace plan that would see Ukraine join the bloc by January 1, 2027, in a move that would mark a significant milestone in the country's integration with the West. According to the draft plan, Ukraine would begin political screening and candidate-status-like negotiations with the EU in the first quarter of 2026, with the aim of closing all 36 negotiating chapters by the end of 2026. The European Commission has stressed that the accession process will have to be accelerated, but must still respect the Union's merit-based rules.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has stated that the EU must remain the "central pillar of a sustainable peace" and that the accession process will be fast-tracked, but still respect the Union's merit-based rules. She signalled that the Commission will open fast-track political screening and grant immediate access to EU funds once the peace plan is formally adopted. EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos has also expressed her support for the draft plan, stating that she is "very happy" about the accession reference and that the Commission will move faster, linking progress to concrete reform benchmarks and preparing "enhanced cooperation" tools to bypass a possible Hungarian veto.

The European Council, presided by Charles Michel, has signalled that the draft is only a starting point and that all 27 states must agree before any accelerated accession can be finalized. The integration roadmap outlined by EU officials envisions a political screening in Q1 2026, opening of negotiations in Q2 2026, monthly chapter closures, interim rights in late 2026, and full membership on January 1, 2027—provided that Ukraine meets a tight set of reform conditions and that no member state blocks the ratification.

The proposed timeline for Ukraine's EU membership is significantly shorter than previous accession periods for other Eastern European countries. The typical Eastern-European accession process takes around 8-12 years, with the fastest accession being Croatia, which took around 10 years. In comparison, the draft peace plan proposes a timeline of just over 1 year, which is unprecedented in EU enlargement history.

The projected impact of the draft peace plan on Ukraine's GDP and EU trade balances is also significant. The plan is expected to boost Ukraine's GDP growth, although the economy is still projected to be around 20% below its pre-war level. The EU is expected to run a significant trade surplus with Ukraine, with Ukrainian agrifood exports more than doubling and accounting for around 8% of EU agrifood imports.
