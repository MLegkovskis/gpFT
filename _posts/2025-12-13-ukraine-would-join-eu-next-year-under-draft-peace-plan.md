**Ukraine could become a full EU member as early as 2025 if the draft peace plan – which couples a cease‑fire with Russian troop withdrawals and elections in occupied regions – is implemented, European officials said on Thursday.** The proposal, circulated by the European Commission, the United States and Kyiv, sets out a timetable that would see Ukraine granted candidate status by the end‑2024 and begin accession negotiations in the first half of 2025, contingent on a verifiable end to hostilities and the completion of a set of benchmark reforms.

## Diplomatic backdrop  
The draft follows a series of high‑level meetings in Brussels and Washington in April 2024, where EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen affirmed that “a credible peace settlement is the pre‑condition for Ukraine’s accession.” Reuters reported that the European Council is slated to vote on candidate status in its October summit, while the US State Department has pledged €1.5 billion in additional assistance to help Ukraine meet EU technical criteria.

## Core elements of the peace plan  
- **Cease‑fire and verification:** An OSCE‑monitored cease‑fire to commence within 30 days of the plan’s adoption.  
- **Russian withdrawal:** Full pull‑out of Russian forces from all Ukrainian territory recognised under international law, verified by UN observers.  
- **Buffer zone:** A demilitarised corridor along the current front line, overseen by NATO’s Joint Force Command.  
- **Elections:** Internationally supervised elections in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions within 12 months of the cease‑fire.  

## Reform milestones tied to accession  
| Reform area | Current score (2023) | Target (2025) | Funding |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------|---------|
| Anti‑corruption (Transparency International) | 126 | ≤ 110 | €250 m EU anti‑corruption fund |
| Judicial independence (World Bank) | 2.3/4 | ≥ 3.0 | €180 m rule‑of‑law programme |
| Public finance management | 68 % of EU standards | 85 % | €120 m fiscal reform aid |

The EU has already released €1.5 billion from the Instrument for Pre‑Accession Assistance to support these reforms, with disbursements linked to quarterly progress reports.

## Timeline and conditions  
- **Q4 2024:** EU Council decision on candidate status, subject to a verified cease‑fire.  
- **Q1‑Q2 2025:** Opening of accession negotiations, covering the 35 EU acquis chapters.  
- **Mid‑2025 onward:** Full membership contingent on completion of the reform package and sustained peace.

## Remaining hurdles  
The plan’s success hinges on Russia’s willingness to withdraw, a factor that remains uncertain despite diplomatic overtures. Additionally, Ukraine must sustain its anti‑corruption drive; the latest National Anti‑Corruption Bureau report shows a 12 % reduction in high‑level graft cases in Q2 2024, but the EU still flags systemic weaknesses. Economic stability is another prerequisite: Ukraine’s GDP grew 3.2 % YoY in Q2 2024, while inflation eased to 5.8 %, both within the EU’s convergence thresholds but vulnerable to external shocks.

## Outlook  
If the draft peace plan materialises, Ukraine’s accession could become the most rapid EU enlargement in the bloc’s history, signalling a decisive geopolitical shift in Eastern Europe. The coming months will test whether diplomatic momentum can translate into the concrete steps required for a historic membership bid.
