**Ukraine could begin formal EU accession talks in 2025, with membership potentially secured as early as 2026, if the draft “peace formula” – a package of security guarantees, economic aid and reform commitments – is accepted by both Kyiv and Brussels.** The proposal, unveiled at the EU‑Ukraine summit in Brussels on 13 March 2024, ties the cessation of hostilities with Russia to a fast‑track integration pathway, signalling the bloc’s most ambitious enlargement move since the 2004 enlargement wave.

## The peace formula and EU accession link  

The draft plan, championed by the European Commission and endorsed by the European Council, offers Ukraine a €30 billion macro‑financial assistance package, a 10‑year security guarantee, and the promise that accession negotiations will commence within twelve months of a verified cease‑fire. In return, Kyiv must enact a suite of reforms covering anti‑corruption (targeting a drop in the Transparency International score from 32 to at least 45 by 2026), judicial independence, and alignment of its market regulations with the EU acquis. Defence spending is to reach 2 % of GDP by 2027, matching NATO benchmarks.

## Timeline and procedural steps  

If the cease‑fire is confirmed by the OSCE by mid‑2025, the European Commission will submit a formal accession request to the Council. Negotiations, typically spanning 2‑3 years, are slated for an accelerated schedule: a “single‑stream” approach will bundle the 35 chapters into three phases, aiming for a concluding vote by the European Parliament in late 2026. Should the Parliament and all 27 member states ratify the accession treaty, Ukraine could become the 28th member by early 2027.

## Reactions from Brussels and Kyiv  

EU leaders have welcomed the linkage as a “strategic lever” to end the conflict. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called it “the most concrete incentive we can offer,” while French President Emmanuel Macron stressed that “membership will remain contingent on genuine reforms.” Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban warned that “political will must translate into measurable progress.” Kyiv’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the plan as “the road to Europe we have fought for,” but cautioned that “the price of peace is reform.”

## Remaining hurdles  

Key challenges persist. Ukraine’s 2023 GDP per capita stood at $3 500, roughly one‑tenth of the EU average of $35 000, raising concerns about economic convergence. The World Bank estimates war‑related damage at $200 billion, equivalent to 100 % of Ukraine’s annual output, underscoring the need for sustained reconstruction funding. Moreover, the EU’s own enlargement fatigue – reflected in a 2023 poll where 58 % of Europeans opposed further expansion – could slow ratification.

## Outlook  

The draft peace formula represents a decisive shift in EU policy, using membership as a diplomatic carrot to secure a durable end to hostilities. Its success will hinge on Kyiv’s ability to deliver rapid, verifiable reforms and on the EU’s willingness to accommodate an accelerated accession timetable amidst internal scepticism. If both sides meet these conditions, Ukraine’s accession could become the defining geopolitical milestone of the mid‑2020s.
