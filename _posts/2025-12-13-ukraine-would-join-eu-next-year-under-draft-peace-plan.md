## Ukraine Could Join the EU by 1 January 2027 under Draft Peace Plan  

**A draft peace proposal presented to Washington this week includes a clause that obliges the European Union to admit Ukraine as a full member on 1 January 2027, a timetable that would compress the bloc’s usual multi‑year accession process into less than two years.**  

## Context and Timing  
The proposal, co‑authored by senior Ukrainian officials and a group of EU member‑state representatives, is intended to underpin negotiations with Russia aimed at ending the war that began in February 2022.  It was first reported by the Irish Times and corroborated by the Financial Times, which quoted sources familiar with the document.  The clause sets a definitive deadline, rather than the open‑ended “candidate status” that has characterised Ukraine’s EU bid since the European Council granted it candidate status in June 2022.  

## Core Requirements  
To meet the 2027 deadline, Kyiv must complete the remaining 36 chapters of the EU acquis, of which only one chapter – the free movement of persons – has been formally closed.  The plan stipulates:  

* **Judicial reform:** demonstrable independence of courts, with at least 80 % of pending corruption cases resolved by mid‑2025.  
* **Anti‑corruption measures:** establishment of a fully operational National Anti‑Corruption Bureau and adoption of EU‑standard public procurement rules by the end of 2025.  
* **Rule‑of‑law benchmarks:** alignment with EU standards in media freedom, with the Press Freedom Index target of a score above 30 by 2026.  

EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos has said the plan would “accelerate technical assessments” and allow EU staff to monitor progress on a quarterly basis, bypassing the traditional unanimity requirement that has allowed Hungary to block formal negotiations.  

## Reactions in Brussels and Beyond  
The European Commission has signalled willingness to “not derail the peace process” by opposing a fast‑track accession, while several member states remain cautious.  Hungary’s government, which has repeatedly vetoed Ukraine’s accession talks, is expected to raise objections, but the draft’s explicit deadline could force a procedural workaround.  Analysts at Eurasia Group rate the probability of full membership on the target date at “near‑zero”, citing the unprecedented speed and the still‑unfinished reform agenda.  

## Strategic Implications  
If realised, Ukraine’s entry would expand the EU’s single market by roughly €150 billion in GDP and extend the bloc’s security perimeter to the Black Sea.  It would also mark the first instance of a post‑Cold‑War enlargement being tied to a peace settlement, potentially reshaping the EU’s normative leverage in Eastern Europe.  

## Remaining Hurdles  
The plan’s success hinges on three variables: (1) the pace of Kyiv’s domestic reforms, (2) consensus among all 27 member states, and (3) the outcome of parallel negotiations with Russia.  Any delay in meeting the accession benchmarks could trigger a diplomatic dead‑lock, while a breakthrough could cement Ukraine’s western integration and alter the regional balance of power.
