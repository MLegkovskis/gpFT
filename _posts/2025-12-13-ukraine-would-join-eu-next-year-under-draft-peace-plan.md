**Ukraine could become a full EU member on 1 January 2027 if the draft peace plan currently being shuttled between Kyiv, Brussels and Washington is adopted, a clause in the document says.** The proposal, which links a cease‑fire and territorial concessions to a fast‑track accession timetable, would compress a process that normally takes a decade into less than two years.  

## The draft plan’s core provision  
The 20‑point peace blueprint, presented to the White House in early December, contains a specific article stating that “Ukraine shall be admitted to the European Union on 1 January 2027”.  The wording was confirmed by several senior officials familiar with the draft, though the exact list of EU actors backing the clause has not been disclosed.  

## How fast‑track differs from the usual route  
Ukraine applied for membership on 28 February 2022 and, as of 12 December 2025, has formally opened only one of the 36 negotiating chapters required for accession.  Under the EU’s “merit‑based” enlargement policy, each chapter must be closed before the next can begin, a process that has taken Croatia eight years and the Western Balkans over a decade.  The proposed timetable would therefore bypass the standard sequencing and grant provisional market access while the remaining chapters are completed.  

## Political backdrop  
The plan is part of a US‑mediated effort to end the war in Ukraine, with President Donald Trump reportedly pressing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept a settlement before the Christmas holidays.  European officials, including Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, have signalled a willingness not to “derail the peace process” by opposing the fast‑track clause, but have stopped short of committing to a fixed date.  EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell described the provision as “ambitious but not yet binding”.  

## Reform hurdles  
Analysts stress that accession hinges on Kyiv’s ability to meet the EU’s Copenhagen criteria.  Key benchmarks include:  

* **Anti‑corruption reforms** – the European Commission and Ukraine signed a joint anti‑graft action plan in November, targeting the closure of the National Anti‑Corruption Bureau’s backlog of 1 800 cases.  
* **Judicial independence** – progress must be demonstrated across at least five of the 36 chapters, notably Chapter 23 (Judiciary) and Chapter 24 (Justice, Freedom and Security).  
* **Economic resilience** – the EU’s €1.5 billion “Ukraine 2 EU” programme aims to mobilise up to €6.5 billion in public and private investment, but GDP growth has stalled at 2.1 % in Q3 2025.  

Eurasia Group’s Europe director Mujtaba Rahman warned that the probability of full membership on the target date is “effectively zero”, but added that the clause could “inject momentum into reforms and force Brussels to innovate its enlargement toolbox”.  

## Member‑state dynamics  
Hungary’s veto threat over opening formal accession negotiations remains a wildcard.  However, a recent statement by EU Council President Charles Michel indicated that the bloc could proceed with “enhanced partnership” measures that sidestep a formal veto while the peace plan is under review.  

## Outlook  
If the draft plan survives scrutiny in Washington and receives a political green light in Brussels, the 2027 accession date would mark an unprecedented acceleration of EU enlargement.  Yet the reality on the ground – ongoing hostilities, incomplete reforms and divergent member‑state positions – suggests that the clause is more a diplomatic lever than a guaranteed timetable.  The coming weeks will reveal whether the promise of a 2027 EU membership can survive the rigours of both peace‑building and accession politics.
