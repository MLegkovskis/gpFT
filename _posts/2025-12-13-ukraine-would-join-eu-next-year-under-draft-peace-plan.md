**Ukraine could become a full European Union member as early as 2025 if the draft peace plan, currently being negotiated in Brussels, is approved and its reform timetable is met.** The proposal, unveiled by the European Commission on 12 March 2024, links a cease‑fire and territorial settlement with a fast‑track accession pathway, stipulating that Kyiv must complete a set of governance, judicial and anti‑corruption reforms within 12 months to trigger the opening of accession talks.  

## The draft peace framework  
The plan, co‑drafted by the European Commission, the Ukrainian presidency and the United Nations, sets out three pillars: (1) a phased withdrawal of Russian forces from occupied oblasts, (2) a security guarantee under the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy, and (3) a conditional EU‑membership track. The Commission’s “Road‑map for Ukraine’s EU accession” lists 27 benchmarks – ranging from public‑finance transparency (target ≥ Eurostat standards by 30 June 2024) to the establishment of an independent anti‑corruption court (by 31 December 2024).  

## Timeline and procedural steps  
- **12 Mar 2024** – Commission adopts the draft peace plan and publishes the accession road‑map.  
- **15 Apr 2024** – European Council agrees to grant Ukraine “candidate status” on a provisional basis, pending verification of the first ten benchmarks.  
- **1 Jul 2024** – Formal assessment by the European Commission’s Directorate‑General for Enlargement; expected positive opinion if 80 % of benchmarks are met.  
- **Q1 2025** – Accession negotiations to commence, with an anticipated 18‑month closing period.  
- **End‑2025** – Full EU membership, contingent on ratification by all 27 member states.  

## Political and economic context  
Ukraine’s economy has begun to stabilise after a 30 % contraction in 2022. The World Bank estimates a 5 % real‑GDP growth in Q3 2024, driven by reconstruction aid that topped €30 billion in the first half of the year. Inflation, which peaked at 27 % in 2023, fell to 9.2 % in September 2024, easing monetary pressures.  

Corruption perception scores have risen from 33 (2022) to 38 (2024) on Transparency International’s index, reflecting the launch of the National Anti‑Corruption Bureau’s digital case‑tracking system. Nevertheless, the European Court of Auditors warns that public‑procurement reforms remain “incomplete”, a risk factor for the accession timetable.  

## Reactions from Brussels and Kyiv  
EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the plan as “the most ambitious peace‑and‑integration package Europe has ever offered”. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the proposal as “a historic bridge to Europe”, while cautioning that “the road is narrow and the work is relentless”.  

## Security implications  
The peace framework envisages a joint EU‑Ukraine rapid‑reaction force of up to 5 000 troops, to be deployed under Article 42.7 of the Treaty on European Union. NATO’s Secretary‑General has welcomed the EU’s security commitment but reiterated that NATO’s Article 5 remains the primary collective‑defence guarantee.

## Outlook  
If Kyiv delivers on the reform agenda and the cease‑fire holds, the 2025 accession target would mark the fastest post‑Cold‑War enlargement in EU history. Failure to meet any of the 27 benchmarks could push the timeline back by several years and jeopardise the peace settlement itself. The coming months will therefore be decisive for both Ukraine’s European future and the broader stability of the continent.
