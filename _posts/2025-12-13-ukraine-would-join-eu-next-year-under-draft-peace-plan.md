**Ukraine could become a full European Union member on 1 January 2027 if the draft peace plan currently being negotiated by the United States, Kyiv and Brussels is adopted.** The proposal, first reported by the *Financial Times* and corroborated by *Reuters* and *The Telegraph*, sets a fixed accession date as part of a broader settlement intended to end the war with Russia. It would require Ukraine to meet the EU’s standard accession criteria – notably reforms on the rule of law, anti‑corruption measures and the alignment of its economy with the EU acquis – within a compressed timetable.

## The draft plan’s key provision

The peace document, circulated among senior officials in December 2025, contains a clause that “Ukraine shall join the European Union by 1 January 2027”. The date is tied to the cessation of hostilities; the plan stipulates that accession would occur within twelve months of any cease‑fire taking effect. The EU’s enlargement commissioner, Marta Kos, has said the clause reflects a “political commitment” but that the actual opening of negotiations will still depend on Kyiv’s reform progress.

## Where Ukraine stands in the accession process

- **Screening completed:** In September 2025 Ukraine finished the EU’s screening of its legislation against the 36 negotiating chapters, a prerequisite for formal talks.  
- **Negotiations launched:** The first intergovernmental conference opened accession talks on 25 June 2024. To date, Kyiv has not closed a single chapter – a pace far slower than the 2027 deadline demands.  
- **Reform benchmarks:** The European Commission has identified three core areas – judiciary independence, public procurement transparency and state‑owned enterprise governance – as “critical for progress”. Failure to meet these benchmarks could trigger a suspension of the accelerated schedule.

## Political reactions and practical hurdles

Member states remain divided. Hungary, which holds a veto over the formal start of negotiations, has signalled continued opposition unless Kyiv abandons its NATO aspirations. Conversely, several Central‑European capitals have welcomed the fast‑track proposal as a “security guarantee” for the continent. EU officials caution that the 2027 target would “upend the merit‑based enlargement framework”, requiring procedural changes such as simultaneous opening of multiple acquis chapters and an early allocation of pre‑accession funds.

## Implications for the peace process

Embedding EU accession in the peace formula aims to make the settlement more attractive to Kyiv and to signal Western resolve. However, analysts at Eurasia Group note a “zero‑percent probability” that full membership will be achieved by the stated date, given the depth of reforms still pending. The clause may nevertheless serve as a diplomatic lever, compelling both sides to accelerate implementation of reforms and to keep the peace negotiations moving forward.
