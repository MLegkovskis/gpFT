**Ukraine would join EU next year under draft peace plan, with significant economic benefits and costs**
Ukraine could become a member of the European Union as early as **2025**, according to a draft peace plan presented by President Volodymyr Zelensky on **June 3, 2024**, as reported by Reuters. This accelerated timeline is expected to bring about substantial economic benefits and costs to both Ukraine and the EU. A study by the Polish Institute of International Affairs estimates that **Ukraine's GDP could increase by up to 26%** within a decade of EU membership, as stated in Forbes (June 30, 2025). Meanwhile, modelling by CEPS suggests that **EU-wide GDP could rise by 0.4-0.6%** over the medium term as a result of increased trade, investment, and productivity gains from Ukraine's accession, according to CEPS (May 2024).

The draft peace plan outlines a significant upfront fiscal burden for the EU, with **short-term direct budgetary cost** of approximately **€175 billion** (about 1.1-1.4% of EU GDP in 2022-23), as estimated by Santander. The **net EU budget cost** over the 2025-2030 transition period is expected to be around **€136 billion**, as stated in the Europeum paper. However, this cost could be offset by **long-term net fiscal contributions** from Ukraine, projected to be around **€2-3 billion per year** after 2030, primarily through reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy, according to the Europeum paper.

The accession of Ukraine to the EU is also expected to have a significant impact on the country's energy security and tech sector. Ukraine's accession could further open up the country's energy potential to the EU, **bolstering the bloc's energy security**, as stated by the EPC (Feb 2024). Additionally, Ukraine's growing tech sector would **support the EU's technological revolution**, according to the Institute Global (2024).

In comparison to other Eastern European countries, such as Poland and Hungary, Ukraine's proposed EU membership timeline is significantly accelerated. The draft peace plan proposes **EU accession by January 1, 2027**, which would be roughly **five years after Ukraine's candidacy was granted**, as reported by the Irish Times. This is in contrast to Poland and Hungary, which took **10-13 years** to join the EU after their initial applications, as stated in the EU enlargement data.

The potential market and investor reactions to Ukraine's accelerated EU membership are expected to be significant. The accession could lead to a **reduction in Ukrainian bond yields**, as investors become more confident in the country's economic prospects, and an **appreciation of the Ukrainian currency**, as stated by various financial analysts. Additionally, **foreign direct investment** is expected to increase, as Ukraine's accession to the EU would provide investors with access to a larger market and a more stable business environment.

In conclusion, Ukraine's potential EU membership in 2025 is expected to have significant economic benefits and costs for both Ukraine and the EU. The accession is expected to bring about substantial economic growth, energy security, and tech sector development, but also requires significant upfront fiscal investments from the EU. As the draft peace plan progresses, it will be important to monitor the market and investor reactions to this development.
