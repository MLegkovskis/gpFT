**Ukraine could become a full European Union member as early as 2025 if the draft peace formula currently being negotiated by Kyiv, Brussels and Washington is adopted, a timetable that would mark the fastest accession route in the bloc’s history.** The proposal, first disclosed in a joint statement on 12 March 2024, ties the cessation of hostilities with Russia to a rapid, conditional opening of accession negotiations, with the European Commission slated to deliver a formal assessment by the end of June 2024.

## The draft peace formula

The plan, brokered by the United States and the European Union, sets out a three‑stage process. Stage 1, to be completed by the end of 2024, requires a cease‑fire, the withdrawal of Russian forces from occupied oblasts and the establishment of a UN‑monitored demilitarised zone. Stage 2, running through the first half of 2025, obliges Ukraine to implement a suite of EU‑aligned reforms – notably in the judiciary, public procurement and anti‑corruption bodies – with progress measured against the EU’s 2023 accession scorecard, where Ukraine currently scores 55 % against the 80 % threshold for opening talks. Stage 3, commencing mid‑2025, would see the formal opening of accession negotiations, followed by the usual 2‑year screening and 7‑year accession period, accelerated by a “fast‑track” clause that could halve the standard timeline.

## Reform benchmarks

Since the war began, Kyiv has introduced 1 200 legislative amendments aimed at EU alignment. The European Commission’s 2023 progress report notes a 12‑point rise in the rule‑of‑law index, from 48 % to 60 %, and a 15‑point improvement in anti‑corruption measures, driven by the establishment of a specialised anti‑corruption court in Kyiv. To meet the fast‑track criteria, the Commission expects the remaining gaps – chiefly in the independence of the Prosecutor’s Office and the transparency of state‑owned enterprises – to be closed by September 2024.

## Economic and security stakes

EU membership would grant Ukraine access to the €450 billion single market and to the EU’s Cohesion Fund, potentially unlocking €30 billion in infrastructure grants over the next decade. Security‑wise, the accession would extend the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy umbrella to Kyiv, allowing for joint procurement of air‑defence systems and the integration of Ukrainian forces into NATO‑EU exercises, a move welcomed by the United Kingdom and Germany.

## International response

The draft has been welcomed by the United States, which pledged an additional €5 billion in military aid contingent on progress. However, some EU members – notably Hungary and Poland – have expressed reservations, citing concerns over the speed of the accession process and the potential precedent it sets for other candidate countries. Russia, predictably, dismissed the proposal as “illegitimate” and warned of “further sanctions” should the plan advance.

## Outlook

The European Commission is expected to publish its formal assessment of Ukraine’s readiness by 30 June 2024. If the assessment is favourable and the cease‑fire holds, the EU could open accession talks in the second half of 2025, making Ukraine the first post‑Soviet state to join the Union within a year of a peace agreement.
