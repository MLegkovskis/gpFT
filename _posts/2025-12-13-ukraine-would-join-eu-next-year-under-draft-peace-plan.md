**Ukraine would join EU next year under draft peace plan**
The European Union is considering a draft peace plan that would make Ukraine a full member of the bloc by **1 January 2027**, a timeline that is being deemed as overly ambitious by many analysts. The plan, which was disclosed to officials in **December 2025**, ties the EU membership trigger to a ceasefire and a political settlement with Russia. However, experts have expressed skepticism about the feasibility of this timeline, with **Mujtaba Rahman**, Europe director at Eurasia Group, stating that "there is a zero per cent probability that Ukraine will be a full EU member state on 1 January 2027".

The projected economic impact of the draft peace plan on Ukraine's GDP and EU trade balances is significant. Ukraine's real GDP is expected to grow by only **0.5%–1%** in 2025-26, while its GDP per-capita is approximately **30%** of the EU average. The country will require massive EU structural-fund support to bridge this convergence gap. The direct cost to the EU budget would be **0.13% of EU GDP**, equivalent to **€136 billion** over the 2021-2027 Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF). However, the total budgetary impact, including cohesion-policy extensions, reconstruction aid, and migration-related costs, is estimated to be between **€130 billion and €200 billion** for the same seven-year window.

The draft peace plan would also have significant implications for EU trade balances. Ukraine's accession would add roughly a **third of the EU's arable land**, pushing the bloc's share of global wheat exports from **23% to approximately 30%**, making the EU the world's top grain exporter. The influx of Ukrainian agricultural output is expected to **improve the EU's trade surplus in agri-food** by an estimated **€5 billion-€8 billion per year**.

The timeline of the draft peace plan is significantly shorter than previous Eastern European accession experiences. The typical accession process takes around **7-12 years**, whereas the draft plan proposes a timeline of just **3 years**. This has raised concerns among EU officials, who have expressed doubts about the feasibility of such a rapid accession process. **Ursula von der Leyen**, European Commission President, has emphasized the need for a credible and sustainable peace plan that respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

In terms of the integration process, EU leaders envision a **reform-driven gate-keeping** approach, where Ukraine's progress through the **30+ negotiating chapters** will dictate the timeline. The EU will also require **unanimous political approval** from all 27 member states, which could be a significant obstacle given Hungary's historic veto on Ukraine's bid. The EU is also exploring **accelerated timeline** options, which would bypass the usual merit-based schedule. However, this would require significant political will and coordination among EU member states.
