### Mexico’s Extortion Crisis and the Super Bowl Avocado Supply
The Super Bowl is one of the largest events for avocado consumption in the United States, with Mexico being the primary supplier. However, the country's extortion crisis has cast a shadow over this lucrative trade. To combat this, avocado suppliers and distributors have implemented various security measures.

#### Security Measures
These measures include the deployment of private security personnel, GPS-enabled pallet and truck tracking, sealed and tamper-evident containers, and coordinated police-industry patrols through the Safe-Road Initiative. Additionally, there is a focus on worker training and threat-awareness workshops to empower pickers to recognize and report extortion attempts.

#### Impact of Security Measures
The impact of these measures has been significant, with a reduction in truck-theft cases by 78% and a decrease in extortion payments by 4%. The use of sealed containers has also led to a drop in container-theft incidents from 42 cases in 2023 to 9 cases in the 2024-25 season. Furthermore, the Safe-Road Initiative has provided a real-time link to the police, allowing for the rerouting of trucks when a threat is reported.

#### Industry-Government Partnership
The partnership between the avocado industry and government agencies, such as the Mexican Navy, has been crucial in keeping port-level incidents at near-zero during the critical Super Bowl weeks. The Navy’s Maritime Security Unit inspects every avocado container, with 99% being cleared without incident.

#### Human-Factor Focus
The focus on the human factor, through the training of thousands of field workers, has lowered on-site intimidation reports by approximately 67%. This not only improves morale but also reduces the likelihood of collusion with criminal groups.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, while Mexico's extortion crisis poses significant challenges to the avocado industry, the measures being taken by suppliers and distributors offer a cautiously optimistic outlook. The layered security approach, data-driven logistics, industry-government partnership, and human-factor focus are all contributing to a safer and more secure supply chain for Super Bowl avocados.
