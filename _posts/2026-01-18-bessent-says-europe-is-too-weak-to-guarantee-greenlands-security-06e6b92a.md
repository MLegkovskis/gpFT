# Bessent Says Europe is Too Weak to Guarantee Greenland's Security
Bessent has stated that Europe lacks the capability to deter Russian and Chinese moves in the Arctic, and that U.S. control or a formal security umbrella would allow for the deployment of missile-defence assets and guarantee NATO-backed protection.
## Security Concerns
The security concerns cited by Bessent include Russian military activity in the Arctic, Chinese strategic push into the Arctic, the U.S. 'Golden Dome' missile-defence concept, NATO guarantee limits, European 'weakness' to project power, and economic leverage tied to security.
## Implications
The implications of Bessent's claim include a potential conflict between the U.S. and Europe, a shift in the balance of Arctic power, and a destabilization of Denmark-Greenland ties.
## Geopolitical Outlook
The overall geopolitical outlook includes a deepening mistrust between the U.S. and Europe, a potential push for an independent European Arctic strategy, and an acceleration of Russian and Chinese Arctic expansion.
