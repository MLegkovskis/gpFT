## Kyiv and European Allies Bolster Position as US‑Led Peace Talks Enter Critical Phase  
**Ukraine and its European partners are intensifying diplomatic pressure on Washington’s peace initiative, seeking stronger security guarantees and financial backing while resisting any substantial territorial concessions to Russia. The latest round of talks, centred on a revised 20‑point Ukrainian plan, coincides with the EU’s decision to freeze €210 billion of Russian assets and Ukraine’s urgent need for an additional €135.7 billion in funding over the next two years.**

## Revised Ukrainian Proposal and Washington’s Role  
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy submitted an updated peace blueprint to the United States in early December 2025. The document reiterates Kyiv’s demand for a legally binding security guarantee, a demilitarised buffer zone along the front line, and a clear timetable for Ukraine’s accession to the European Union. US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, appointed by President Donald Trump, met Zelenskyy and senior European officials in Berlin on 13 December, signalling Washington’s willingness to broker a settlement but also pressing Kyiv to consider limited territorial adjustments.

## European Commitment and Financial Measures  
The United Kingdom, France and Germany have dispatched their top leaders—Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Friedrich Merz—to the Berlin talks, underscoring a coordinated European stance. The European Union, through a consensus reached on 12 December, has indefinitely frozen approximately €210 billion of Russian sovereign assets held in European banks, a move designed to both penalise Moscow and create a pool of resources that could be redirected to Ukraine under any future agreement.

## Core Negotiation Points  
1. **Security Guarantees:** Kyiv insists on a NATO‑style assurance that any peace deal must protect its sovereignty and prevent future aggression.  
2. **Territorial Issues:** While Moscow seeks recognition of its annexations, Ukraine maintains that any concession must be reversible and linked to a credible international monitoring mechanism.  
3. **Economic Aid:** The €135.7 billion funding gap reflects the cost of sustaining Ukraine’s defence, reconstruction and the anticipated EU accession process.  

## Outlook and Remaining Obstacles  
Diplomatic momentum appears to be building, yet the path to a durable settlement remains fraught. The buffer‑zone concept, proposed by the United States, requires precise demarcation and verification, while the EU’s asset‑freeze mechanism must be reconciled with legal challenges from member states such as Hungary and Slovakia. Moreover, the timing of any security guarantee—potentially contingent on NATO’s formal involvement—adds further complexity.

## Conclusion  
As the peace process reaches a decisive juncture, Kyiv and its European allies are leveraging both political clout and financial instruments to strengthen their negotiating hand. Washington’s leadership, embodied in Envoy Witkoff’s shuttle diplomacy, provides a conduit for dialogue, but the ultimate success of the talks will hinge on reconciling security guarantees, territorial integrity and the massive fiscal shortfall confronting Ukraine.
