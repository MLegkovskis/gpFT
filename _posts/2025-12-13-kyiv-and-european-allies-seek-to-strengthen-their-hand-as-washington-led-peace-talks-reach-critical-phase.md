**Kyiv and its European partners are tightening their negotiating position as Washington‑led peace talks enter a decisive stage, with the United States urging a Ukrainian withdrawal from Donetsk while the EU re‑affirms its commitment to Kyiv’s territorial integrity.**  

## Diplomatic Context  
The peace process, launched in March 2024 under a U.S.‑sponsored framework, has progressed to a “critical phase” following a series of high‑level meetings in Brussels and Washington in November 2025. President Joe Trump’s administration presented an updated plan on 11 December 2025 that, for the first time, includes a proposal for a “free economic zone” in the eastern Donetsk region, conditional on a phased Ukrainian pull‑back.  

## European Stance  
European Union foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels on 12 December 2025, issued a joint communiqué reiterating “unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and the inviolability of its internationally recognised borders.” The statement highlighted €50 billion in EU assistance pledged for 2025‑2026, of which €12 billion is earmarked for reconstruction in liberated territories.  

## Ukrainian Response  
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking to a domestic audience on 11 December, acknowledged the U.S. proposal but stressed that any territorial concession must be “reciprocal and verifiable.” He warned that a premature withdrawal could jeopardise the security of the 7 million internally displaced persons still in the conflict zone.  

## Key Challenges  
1. **Territorial Guarantees** – Moscow has demanded a legally binding ceasefire and the removal of NATO‑linked weapons from Ukraine before any withdrawal.  
2. **Security Arrangements** – Both sides dispute the composition of a proposed monitoring force, with Kyiv insisting on NATO participation and Moscow preferring a neutral, OSCE‑led body.  
3. **Humanitarian Access** – Recent Russian shelling in the Kharkiv region, which killed three civilians on 10 December, underscores the fragility of the ceasefire and complicates aid delivery.  

## Strategic Calculus  
- **United States**: Allocates $45 billion in military aid for 2025, coupled with diplomatic pressure to secure a settlement that limits Russian strategic depth.  
- **European Allies**: Balance between sustaining military support (averaging €1.5 billion per month) and avoiding a settlement that could be perceived as rewarding aggression.  
- **Russia**: Maintains control over approximately 15 % of Ukrainian territory, with its forces reportedly “completely cut off” from the strategic hub of Kupiansc as of 12 December, according to Ukrainian military sources.  

## Outlook  
The next round of talks, scheduled for early January 2026 in Geneva, will test whether the United States can broker a compromise that satisfies Kyiv’s demand for sovereignty, the EU’s insistence on a robust verification regime, and Moscow’s insistence on security guarantees. The outcome will shape not only the future of the Ukrainian front but also the broader architecture of European security.
