**Kyiv and its European partners are sharpening their negotiating position ahead of the next round of US‑led peace talks, seeking guarantees on Ukraine’s territorial integrity, security arrangements and post‑war reconstruction as the process enters a decisive phase.**  

## Context and Timeline  

The diplomatic track, convened by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, convened its first plenary in Geneva on 3 June 2024 and is slated to reconvene on 12 June. The talks follow a series of “road‑map” meetings in Brussels (28 May) and Washington (15 May) that produced a draft framework covering cease‑fire sequencing, prisoner‑of‑war swaps and a timetable for political dialogue.  

## Ukrainian Demands  

President Volodymyr Zelensky’s office reiterated on 5 June that any settlement must:  

* Restore the pre‑February 2022 borders, including the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions (approximately 120 000 km², 20 % of Ukraine’s territory).  
* Secure a legally binding security guarantee from the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union, comparable to NATO’s Article 5.  
* Ensure the full return of over 200 000 Ukrainian prisoners of war, a figure cited by the International Committee of the Red Cross.  

## European Coordination  

The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell confirmed on 7 June that the bloc will present a unified position, backed by €15 billion in additional reconstruction assistance earmarked for the first three years after a cease‑fire. The United Kingdom pledged a further £2 billion in humanitarian aid and pledged to host a “re‑integration forum” for displaced persons. Germany and France, together, announced a joint €3 billion package for de‑mining and infrastructure repair, to be disbursed through the European Peace Facility.  

## US Mediation and Expectations  

Washington’s draft proposal, released on 10 June, outlines a phased cease‑fire beginning with a 30‑day humanitarian pause, followed by a 90‑day exchange of prisoners and a 12‑month timeline for the withdrawal of Russian forces from occupied oblasts. The US has signalled it will not endorse any agreement that leaves Russian troops on Ukrainian soil beyond 30 June 2024.  

## Challenges Ahead  

Key sticking points remain: the definition of “security guarantees”, the status of the self‑declared “people’s republics” in the east, and the sequencing of sanctions relief. Russian negotiators have so far rejected any clause that mandates a full withdrawal, insisting on “recognition of the new realities”.  

## Outlook  

With the Geneva summit only a week away, Kyiv and its European allies are leveraging a combined €20 billion in military and reconstruction aid to press for a settlement that preserves Ukraine’s sovereignty while offering a credible pathway to peace. The next 48 hours will be critical for aligning the US‑EU‑UK positions before they are presented to the Russian delegation, and for gauging whether the diplomatic momentum can translate into a durable cease‑fire.
