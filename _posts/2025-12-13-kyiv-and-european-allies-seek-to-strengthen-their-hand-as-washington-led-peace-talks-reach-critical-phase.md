**Kyiv and European allies seek to strengthen their hand as Washington-led peace talks reach critical phase**
As the Washington-led peace talks on the Ukraine conflict reach a critical phase, Kyiv and its European allies are seeking to strengthen their hand in the negotiations. The talks, which have been ongoing for several months, aim to find a comprehensive settlement to the conflict, which has lasted for over four years and resulted in over 100,000 military and civilian deaths. According to [DW – U.S. plan overview](https://www.dw.com/en/us-plan-to-end-russias-war-in-ukraine-where-it-stands-now/a-75125356), the current talks differ significantly from previous negotiations, such as the Minsk agreements, in terms of scope and potential outcomes.

The current talks, led by the United States with heavy European participation, involve a broader range of parties, including Ukraine, Russia, and a bloc of around 30 European allies. The talks are focused on finding a comprehensive settlement that could include territorial swaps, joint nuclear plant control, and a security-guarantee package for Ukraine. As stated by [U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff](https://www.dw.com/en/us-plan-to-end-russias-war-in-ukraine-where-it-stands-now/a-75125356), "We are pushing for a 20-point plan that includes a demilitarised line of contact and joint governance of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant." In contrast, the Minsk agreements were limited to a regional cease-fire and constitutional reform framework, mediated by the OSCE and a handful of European states.

The European Union has been playing a crucial role in the talks, with key leaders such as Ursula von der Leyen and Emmanuel Macron taking a tough but pragmatic stance. As [von der Leyen stated](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/09/ukraine-at-critical-moment-in-war-european-allies-ramp-up-russia-pressure.html), "Our priority is to cement security guarantees for Ukraine from continental allies." The EU has frozen roughly €210 billion of Russian sovereign assets, with €90 billion of that being liquid and available for mobilization for a loan to Kyiv. This move is intended to give Kyiv leverage in the talks and to signal that the EU will keep economic pressure on Moscow.

The reactions of key European leaders, such as Macron and von der Leyen, have been significant in shaping the EU's future relationship with Russia. As [Macron stated](https://www.facebook.com/kyivindependent/posts/us-policy-choices-are-forcing-europe-into-a-strategic-moment-it-long-tried-to-av/886520677217336/), "There can be no peace without respect for Ukrainian sovereignty." The EU's emphasis on security guarantees and its willingness to use economic tools while keeping diplomatic channels open suggest a dual-track approach. This approach aims to maintain pressure on Moscow while preserving a legal foothold for future dialogue.

The potential long-term outcomes of the talks are significant, with the EU seeking to establish a "managed competition" model with Russia. This model would involve economic sanctions and asset-use on the Russian side, coupled with a diplomatic framework that recognizes the EU's role as a security guarantor in Eastern Europe. As [the European Council stated](https://www.ft.com/war-in-ukraine), "We will continue to use frozen Russian assets as a bargaining chip, but we also seek a diplomatic path that does not permanently alienate Russia."

In conclusion, the Washington-led peace talks on the Ukraine conflict have reached a critical phase, with Kyiv and its European allies seeking to strengthen their hand in the negotiations. The EU has been playing a crucial role in the talks, with key leaders taking a tough but pragmatic stance. The potential long-term outcomes of the talks are significant, with the EU seeking to establish a "managed competition" model with Russia.
