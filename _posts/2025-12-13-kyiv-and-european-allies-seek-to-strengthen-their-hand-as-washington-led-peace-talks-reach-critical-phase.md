**Kyiv and its European partners are sharpening their diplomatic leverage as Washington‑led peace negotiations enter a decisive stage, with Ukraine having tabled a 20‑point counter‑proposal on 11 December, the EU freezing €210 billion of Russian assets and a €135.7 billion funding gap looming for Kyiv’s reconstruction programme.**  

## Updated Ukrainian Blueprint  

On 11 December President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that Kyiv had delivered an updated peace framework to the United States, outlining twenty concrete items ranging from a demilitarised zone in the Donbas to guarantees for free, internationally‑monitored elections within 60‑90 days of a ceasefire. The proposal, disclosed by presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak to *Le Monde*, also calls for a referendum on any territorial adjustments and seeks a security umbrella from Washington and its European allies before any concessions are considered.  

## US Mediation and the Berlin Summit  

U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is scheduled to meet Zelenskyy and senior European officials in Berlin on 13 December, a session described by *DW* as the “crunch round” of the diplomatic push. The talks will focus on reconciling the Ukrainian counter‑proposal with the U.S. peace plan, which, according to *Reuters*, still demands significant territorial compromises and a wartime election timetable that Kyiv finds unacceptable.  

## European Financial and Military Backing  

European capitals have reiterated their support. On 12 December the EU agreed to keep frozen Russian sovereign assets—valued at roughly €210 billion (£185 billion, $247 billion)—in place indefinitely, a move intended to fund future reconstruction and to pressure Moscow, *BBC* reports. Simultaneously, the European Commission warned that Ukraine faces an additional €135.7 billion (£119 billion, $159 billion) funding shortfall over the next two years, prompting calls for a coordinated “Marshall Plan”‑style package.  

## On‑the‑Ground Pressures  

The diplomatic urgency is underscored by renewed Russian strikes that, on 13 December, knocked out power to over 200 000 households across seven Ukrainian regions, *Al Jazeera* notes. Kyiv has responded with limited cross‑border drone attacks on Russian military infrastructure, a tactic it says is aimed at dual‑use targets and is intended to bolster its bargaining position.  

## Remaining Hurdles  

Key sticking points remain: the status of occupied territories in Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson; the timing and monitoring of elections; and the scope of security guarantees for Kyiv post‑conflict. Russian Foreign Ministry statements, cited by *Understanding War*, indicate Moscow will not accept the original 28‑point U.S. plan without further concessions, particularly on the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from unoccupied parts of the Donbas.  

## Outlook  

With the Berlin summit imminent, the next 48 hours will likely determine whether a mutually acceptable ceasefire and political settlement can be forged or whether the conflict will persist into another year of attrition. The alignment of Ukrainian demands, European financial commitments and U.S. diplomatic flexibility will be the decisive factor in shaping the post‑war order in Eastern Europe.
