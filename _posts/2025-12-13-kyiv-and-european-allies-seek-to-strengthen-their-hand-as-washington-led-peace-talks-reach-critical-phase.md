**Kyiv and its European partners are sharpening their diplomatic leverage as Washington‑led peace negotiations with Moscow enter a decisive stage, with the United States’ special envoy Steve Witkoff slated to meet President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and senior European leaders in Berlin on 14 December 2025. The talks focus on Ukraine’s territorial claims in Donetsk, the status of the Russian‑occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and a package of security guarantees tied to the proposed use of roughly $100 billion in frozen Russian assets.**

## Updated peace blueprint

On 12 December 2025 Kyiv submitted a revised 20‑point peace plan to the White House. The document expands the original U.S. proposal by adding explicit NATO‑style security assurances, a timetable for the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Donbas, and a clause that would channel a portion of frozen Russian sovereign‑wealth funds into reconstruction projects in Ukraine. The plan also proposes a conditional pathway for Ukraine’s accession to the European Union by early 2027, a point that has drawn scepticism from Brussels, which warns that accession criteria cannot be fast‑tracked without legislative reform.

## European coordination

European capitals are converging on a common negotiating position. In a joint statement released on 13 December, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the Benelux states affirmed “a united front on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity” while urging Washington to secure “binding security guarantees” before Kyiv concedes any land. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are all scheduled to join Witkoff in Berlin, signalling a rare alignment of NATO’s largest members behind Kyiv’s demands.

## U.S. pressure and Trump’s impatience

President Donald Trump has publicly warned that his administration’s patience is wearing thin, demanding a “final deal before Christmas” and accusing European allies of “weakness”. Nonetheless, senior White House officials have indicated that any agreement must respect international law and provide a credible deterrent against future Russian aggression. The administration’s leverage rests on the prospect of allocating the frozen Russian assets, which the International Monetary Fund estimates could generate up to $120 billion in annual interest for Ukraine’s post‑war rebuild.

## Russian response

Moscow has so far rejected any proposal that entails a full withdrawal from Donetsk, insisting on a “protective status” for the region and continued control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Kovalev reiterated on 13 December that any ceasefire must be contingent on Ukraine’s “complete demilitarisation” of the front line, a demand Kyiv deems unacceptable.

## Outlook

With the Berlin summit imminent, the balance of power hinges on whether European allies can extract firm security guarantees from Washington while preserving Ukraine’s core territorial claims. The outcome will shape not only the immediate ceasefire prospects but also the longer‑term architecture of European security and the fate of the frozen Russian assets earmarked for reconstruction.
