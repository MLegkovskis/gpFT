**Kyiv and its European partners are sharpening diplomatic leverage as US‑led peace negotiations with Moscow move into a decisive stage, seeking guarantees on security, territory and post‑conflict governance before any settlement is drafted.**  

## Diplomatic Context  

The United States has been chairing a series of informal talks in Geneva since March 2024, aiming to bridge gaps between Kyiv and Moscow after the stalled Minsk accords. Recent sessions have seen heightened activity from the “Normandy Four” – France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States – each urging Kyiv to present a clear red‑line package while pressing Moscow for a verifiable ceasefire. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a press briefing on 10 December that “the window for a credible agreement is narrowing; we must ensure any deal safeguards sovereignty and the rule of law.”  

## European Reinforcement  

European capitals have responded with a coordinated surge in political and material support.  

* **EU Military Aid:** On 5 December the European Union approved an additional €1.2 billion in defence assistance, earmarked for air‑defence systems, artillery and training programmes, bringing total EU aid to €13 billion since the war began.  
* **Economic Guarantees:** The European Investment Bank pledged €2 billion in reconstruction loans contingent on a ceasefire, while the European Commission announced a €500 million “peace‑building” fund to support decentralisation reforms in the Donbas.  
* **Strategic Diplomacy:** France and Germany have each dispatched senior envoys to Kyiv for a joint “hand‑strengthening” summit on 12 December, intended to align their positions before the next Geneva round scheduled for mid‑January 2025.  

## Kyiv’s Core Demands  

Ukraine’s negotiating brief, leaked to diplomatic circles on 8 December, outlines three non‑negotiable pillars:  

1. **Full withdrawal of Russian forces from all occupied territories, including Crimea, within a 30‑day verification period.**  
2. **A legally binding security guarantee from the United States and NATO, encompassing a mutual‑defence clause should Russian aggression resume.**  
3. **Implementation of a comprehensive de‑occupation and reconstruction programme, overseen by an international monitoring body.**  

Analysts note that Kyiv’s insistence on a NATO‑style guarantee marks a shift from earlier, more ambiguous language, reflecting confidence derived from recent NATO summit commitments.  

## Obstacles and Prospects  

The principal stumbling block remains Moscow’s demand for recognition of the “special status” of the Donbas and a phased withdrawal tied to guarantees on the rights of Russian‑speaking minorities. Additionally, the status of Crimea remains a diplomatic taboo; Russian officials have repeatedly dismissed any discussion of its return.  

Nevertheless, the convergence of US diplomatic pressure, a fresh EU aid package and a coordinated European diplomatic front has altered the bargaining calculus. If Kyiv can secure firm security assurances, the likelihood of a ceasefire‑first framework – the model favoured by Washington – increases.  

The coming weeks will test whether the reinforced European‑Ukrainian hand can extract concessions sufficient to shape a durable settlement, or whether entrenched positions will push the conflict into another protracted stalemate.
