**Kyiv and its European partners are sharpening their diplomatic leverage ahead of the next round of US‑led peace negotiations, seeking guarantees on Ukraine’s sovereignty, a robust cease‑fire framework and a clear roadmap for post‑war reconstruction as the talks enter a decisive phase.**  

## Context and Timeline  

The peace process, convened by the Biden administration, convened its latest session in Geneva on 10 April 2025, bringing together senior officials from Kyiv, Washington and the European Union. Earlier this month, the European Council endorsed a €30 billion assistance package for Ukraine’s reconstruction, signalling a united front ahead of the talks.  

## Ukrainian Objectives  

President Volodymyr Zelensky’s delegation has outlined three non‑negotiable pillars:  

* **Territorial integrity** – full restoration of the 2022 borders, including the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.  
* **Security guarantees** – a legally binding commitment from the United States and NATO to provide a “defence umbrella” for at least ten years, encompassing air‑defence systems and intelligence sharing.  
* **Humanitarian corridor** – immediate establishment of a UN‑monitored corridor to facilitate the safe return of an estimated 5 million internally displaced persons.  

## European Stance  

The United Kingdom, Germany and France have each pledged to back Kyiv’s demands with diplomatic pressure on Moscow. In a joint statement on 8 April, the three capitals warned that any settlement lacking “full respect for Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty” would be deemed untenable. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, announced an additional €2 billion in military aid, while France confirmed the deployment of a European Union monitoring mission to the contested zones.  

## US Role and Expectations  

Washington is positioning itself as the primary facilitator, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken chairing the Geneva talks. The US has offered a “comprehensive security package” valued at $15 billion, encompassing Patriot missile batteries, F‑16 aircraft transfers and a pledge to extend the NATO‑Ukraine partnership beyond 2028. Blinken reiterated that the United States expects “a durable cease‑fire and a clear timetable for the withdrawal of Russian forces”.  

## Remaining Hurdles  

Key sticking points remain:  

* **Russian preconditions** – Moscow continues to demand recognition of the so‑called “people’s republics” in Donetsk and Luhansk, a demand Kyiv has rejected.  
* **Verification mechanisms** – both sides dispute the scope of UN‑led monitoring, with Russia insisting on a joint Russian‑Ukrainian commission.  
* **Reconstruction funding** – the EU’s €30 billion pledge must be matched by private investment, a target that analysts estimate will require an additional €20 billion.  

## Outlook  

The next round of negotiations, slated for 22 April, will focus on drafting a cease‑fire protocol and outlining the security guarantees framework. While diplomatic momentum appears strong, the final outcome will hinge on whether Kyiv and its European allies can maintain a cohesive bargaining position without conceding on core sovereignty issues. A successful settlement could pave the way for a phased withdrawal of Russian forces and the commencement of a multi‑year reconstruction programme, reshaping the security architecture of Eastern Europe.
