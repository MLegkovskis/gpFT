## Kyiv and European Allies Bolster Hand as US‑Led Peace Talks Reach Critical Phase  

**Ukraine and its European partners are intensifying diplomatic pressure ahead of a decisive round of US‑spearheaded negotiations with Russia, seeking to lock in security guarantees, reconstruction funding and a clear timetable for withdrawal of Russian forces.**  

## Recent diplomatic activity  

- **15 December 2024 – Kyiv:** President Volodymyr Zelensky hosted a summit with the foreign ministers of Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Poland. The communiqué pledged an additional **€3.2 billion** in military aid and **€1.5 billion** in humanitarian assistance, bringing total European support in 2024 to **€12.4 billion**.  
- **18 December 2024 – Brussels:** The European Council endorsed a “Joint Peace Initiative” that will channel **€2 billion** from the European Peace Facility into post‑conflict reconstruction, conditional on a verified cease‑fire.  
- **20 December 2024 – Washington:** Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the next tranche of US‑led talks will be held in Geneva on **5 January 2025**, with a target of a **30‑day** cease‑fire window to enable humanitarian corridors.  

## US‑led peace process: where it stands  

The United States has been steering a “peace formula” since March 2024, comprising three pillars: (1) security guarantees for Ukraine, (2) a phased Russian withdrawal, and (3) a reconstruction package. As of 20 December, the formula has secured **formal acceptance by 7 of 12** European NATO members, but Russia has yet to endorse any element.  

- **Security guarantees:** The US has pledged **$2 billion** in security assistance, contingent on a cease‑fire.  
- **Withdrawal timetable:** Draft proposals call for a **10‑week** phased pull‑out of Russian troops from the Donbas, with verification by the OSCE.  
- **Reconstruction fund:** A joint US‑EU pool of **$15 billion** is earmarked for infrastructure, energy and de‑mining, to be released after the first verification checkpoint.  

## European leverage  

European capitals are using their combined fiscal clout to shape the agenda. Germany’s **€1 billion** weapons package, announced on 12 December, includes 40 Panzerhaubitze 2000 howitzers and 12 Eurofighter‑Typhoons earmarked for Ukraine’s air defence. The United Kingdom has committed **£500 million** for advanced air‑defence systems, while France is supplying **12 CAESAR** self‑propelled howitzers.  

These commitments are being presented as “pre‑conditions” for any peace settlement that does not guarantee the **restoration of Ukraine’s pre‑2022 borders**.  

## Potential outcomes and risks  

Analysts at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) warn that without a binding security guarantee, any cease‑fire could be short‑lived; they estimate a **45 %** probability that negotiations will stall before the 5 January summit. Conversely, the combined European aid package raises the probability of a **30 %** chance of a breakthrough, according to a recent Monte‑Carlo simulation by the European Council on Foreign Relations.  

Key risk factors remain: (i) Russian domestic politics, where President Vladimir Putin faces declining approval (down to **38 %** in recent polls), (ii) the pace of Ukrainian counter‑offensives in the south, and (iii) the willingness of the United States to sustain a high‑level diplomatic push beyond the early‑2025 timeframe.  

## Outlook  

The coming weeks will test whether Kyiv’s diplomatic offensive, underpinned by a coordinated European financial and military package, can translate into tangible concessions from Moscow. The Geneva summit on **5 January 2025** is poised to be the litmus test for the durability of the US‑led peace process.
