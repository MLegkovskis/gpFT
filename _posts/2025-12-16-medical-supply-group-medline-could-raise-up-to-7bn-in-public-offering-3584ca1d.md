**Medline Industries is poised to launch what could become the largest U.S. IPO of 2025, targeting a valuation of up to $55 billion and seeking to raise as much as $7 billion in fresh capital.** The company’s prospectus sets the price band at $26‑$30 per share for 179 million shares, a structure that would deliver $5.37 billion at the top of the range and, if demand warrants, could be upsized to the $7 billion ceiling. The offering would dwarf the $30 billion private‑equity valuation the medical‑supply group commanded in 2020, representing roughly an 80 percent uplift.

The IPO filing, announced in mid‑December, positions Medline at the forefront of a sector that has traditionally been dominated by privately held manufacturers. By pricing the float at the upper end of the band, the company would secure a market capitalisation of $55 billion, a figure that would eclipse the $34 billion leveraged buyout that reshaped ownership in 2021. Analysts note that the scale of the raise would provide Medline with a war‑chest to accelerate expansion of distribution centres, modernise manufacturing facilities and invest in digital health technologies.

The move marks a stark departure from Medline’s earlier attempts to tap private‑equity capital in the early 2010s. In March 2010 the firm entered talks with private‑equity investors about a minority stake that could have delivered up to $2 billion, and a further round of discussions in 2011 floated a $3 billion valuation without any firm commitment. Those negotiations sought minority equity and left the Mills family firmly in control. By contrast, the 2025 public offering will dilute the family’s holding, albeit the Mills remain the controlling shareholder, while opening the capital structure to a broad base of institutional and retail investors.

The strategic rationale behind the public listing is equally distinct. Private‑equity talks of a decade ago were aimed at raising capital while preserving the company’s private status, allowing Medline to fund incremental growth without the scrutiny of public markets. The current IPO, however, is framed as an “upsized share sale” designed to tap the depth of the U.S. equity market, enhance liquidity for existing shareholders and position the group for a new phase of scale‑driven expansion. The potential $7 billion influx dwarfs the $2‑$3 billion that private‑equity discussions ever envisaged, underscoring a shift from modest, private financing to a bold public capital raise.

If the offering proceeds as planned, Medline will join a limited cohort of healthcare manufacturers that have accessed public markets at a comparable scale. The influx of capital could intensify competition in the medical‑supply chain, prompting rivals to seek similar financing routes or to consolidate. Moreover, the IPO could set a benchmark for valuation multiples in a sector where private‑equity deals have traditionally set price precedents.

In sum, Medline’s public‑offering plan reflects a decisive pivot from the cautious, private‑equity‑driven financing of the early 2010s to an ambitious, market‑oriented capital strategy. The anticipated valuation of up to $55 billion and the potential $7 billion raise would not only reshape the company’s balance sheet but also signal a broader appetite among investors for exposure to the resilient medical‑supply industry.
