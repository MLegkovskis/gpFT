### Merz's China Trip: Aims and Objectives
Chancellor Friedrich Merz's two-day trip to China, which took place from February 24 to 25, 2026, was explicitly aimed at rebalancing trade relations and reducing Germany's €5 billion trade deficit. The primary objectives of the trip included closing the widening trade gap, securing fair market access for German industry, reducing strategic dependencies on Chinese supply chains, leveraging China's geopolitical influence on Russia, and setting the political pre-conditions for a EU-wide 'level-playing-field' package.

### Key Takeaways
- The trip resulted in no major 'headline' investment announcements but is expected to produce sector-specific memoranda, such as EV battery supply-chain cooperation and standards-recognition for German machinery.
- Merz's visit aligns with the EU's Strategic Autonomy policy, which seeks to diversify supply chains away from both Beijing and Washington while preserving economic ties.
- The trip navigates US-China tensions and addresses security issues like Taiwan and Ukraine, demonstrating Germany's role as a moderating force within the EU.

### Geopolitical Landscape
The visit comes at a time when EU-China relations are under intense diplomatic pressure, following the EU's 'strategic autonomy' drive launched in 2024. Merz's trip reinforces Germany's commitment to the EU's collective bargaining position while seeking limited, sector-specific economic channels with Beijing.
