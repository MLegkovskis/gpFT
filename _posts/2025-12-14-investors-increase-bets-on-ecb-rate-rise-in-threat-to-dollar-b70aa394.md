**Investors are now pricing a roughly 30 % chance that the European Central Bank will lift its policy rate before the end of 2026, a move that could dent the dollar’s dominance even as the euro‑area economy shows unexpected resilience.** The deposit‑rate sits at 2.00 % and Eurodollar‑swap markets imply a modest 25‑basis‑point rise to about 2.25 % for October 2026. Yet the consensus among economists remains that the ECB will hold steady through 2026, with most forecasts pointing to the first hike not until mid‑2027. 

The current market view stands in stark contrast to the decisive tightening of 2011. Back then the ECB delivered two 25‑basis‑point hikes within six months, taking the benchmark from 1.00 % to 1.50 % as inflation ran at 2.7 % – well above the 2 % target. By comparison, today’s potential first move would be a single 25‑basis‑point step, and the policy rate is already 2.00 %, a full percentage point higher than the starting point in 2011. Inflation has eased to around 2.3 % in December 2025, still above target but markedly lower than the 2011 peak. The longer time horizon – five to six years from now to the first expected hike – signals a more cautious stance than the rapid tightening of a decade ago. 

Underlying the ECB’s restraint is a surprisingly robust growth picture. Euro‑area GDP expanded by 1.4 % year‑on‑year in the third quarter of 2025, outpacing the central bank’s own forecasts and delivering a 0.3 % quarter‑on‑quarter gain. The October 2025 meeting left the deposit rate unchanged at 2.00 % for the third consecutive session, with policymakers noting that “the bar for any policy adjustment is clearly high”. Subsequent analyses from ING and other forecasters argue that the upside GDP surprise will prompt the ECB to raise its growth projections, but that the data “has done very little to justify any rate change” at the December meeting. 

The interplay of modest inflation, stronger‑than‑expected growth and a higher starting rate creates a delicate balancing act. On the one hand, the euro‑area’s resilience reduces the urgency for immediate easing, allowing the ECB to maintain a neutral stance while monitoring price pressures. On the other, the market’s 30 % probability of a near‑term hike reflects lingering concerns that inflation could re‑accelerate, especially if energy and commodity prices rise again. 

For investors, the implication is clear: a potential ECB rate rise, however modest, would narrow the interest‑rate differential with the United States and could weaken the dollar in the coming months. Currency traders are already adjusting positions, pricing in the possibility of a tighter euro that would lift the euro‑dollar pair. Yet the prevailing view remains that any substantive shift in policy is still several years away, keeping the dollar’s near‑term advantage largely intact. 

In sum, while the size of a prospective 2026‑27 hike mirrors the incremental steps taken in 2011, the timing, starting level and macro‑economic backdrop differ markedly. The euro’s modest upward pressure on the dollar is real, but it is tempered by a cautious ECB that prefers to watch the economy closely before committing to a tighter monetary path.
