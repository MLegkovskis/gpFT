**Investors Increase Bets on ECB Rate Rise, Putting the Dollar Under Pressure**

The gap between euro‑zone and U.S. 10‑year government bond yields has narrowed by roughly 28 basis points over the past quarter, signalling that markets are pricing in a higher probability of a European Central Bank (ECB) rate hike and a consequent challenge to the dollar’s dominance【<https://ycharts.com/indicators/10year_eurozone_central_government_bond_par_yield_curve】【https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield】.> As euro‑zone yields edge upward while U.S. yields rise more modestly, the relative attractiveness of euro‑denominated assets improves, prompting investors to rebalance away from the greenback.

The latest figures, as of mid‑December 2025, show the euro‑zone 10‑year par yield at **3.24 %**, up from 3.00 % at the end of September, while the U.S. 10‑year Treasury sits at **4.18 %**, a slight increase from 4.22 % in September. The resulting spread—U.S. yield minus euro‑zone yield—has contracted from **1.22 percentage points (122 bps)** to **0.94 percentage points (94 bps)**, a **‑28 bps** shift【<https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/government-bond-yield】.> This tightening reflects a modest rise in euro‑zone yields (3.11 % → 3.24 %) alongside a smaller rise in U.S. yields (4.08 % → 4.18 %).  

Market participants interpret the narrowing spread as a signal that the ECB is likely to tighten monetary policy sooner rather than later. Higher euro‑zone yields reduce the yield differential that traditionally favours the dollar, making euro‑denominated assets more competitive on a risk‑adjusted basis. In a climate where the Federal Reserve has already signalled a pause after a series of hikes, the prospect of an ECB rate increase creates a “two‑way” pressure on the dollar: a slower Fed path combined with a potentially more aggressive European stance.

The dynamics are reinforced by the broader macro‑environment. Euro‑zone inflation, while still above the ECB’s 2 % target, has shown signs of moderation, yet the central bank’s credibility hinges on demonstrating a willingness to act decisively. Investors, therefore, are pricing in a “policy‑tightening premium” that pushes euro yields higher, narrowing the transatlantic spread. The effect is immediate in the foreign‑exchange market, where the euro has appreciated modestly against the dollar in recent weeks, reflecting the market’s anticipation of a rate hike.

For U.S. investors, the narrowing spread raises the cost of holding dollar‑denominated bonds relative to euro assets, prompting a reallocation toward European sovereigns and corporate debt. Portfolio managers are also revisiting currency‑hedged strategies, as the euro’s upside potential appears more credible than the dollar’s, especially if the ECB’s next move aligns with the market’s expectations.

In sum, the 28‑basis‑point contraction in the euro‑U.S. 10‑year yield spread is a tangible metric of shifting expectations. It underscores a growing consensus that the ECB will raise rates, a development that could erode the dollar’s safe‑haven status and reshape capital flows across the Atlantic.
