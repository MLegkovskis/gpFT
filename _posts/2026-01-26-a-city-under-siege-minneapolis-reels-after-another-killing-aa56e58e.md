### A City Under Siege: Minneapolis Reels After Another Killing
The city of Minneapolis is reeling after another killing at the hands of federal immigration agents. On January 23-24, 2026, Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive-care nurse, was shot and killed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement/Border Patrol officers. This incident comes just 16 days after the killing of Renee Good, a 27-year-old Minnesota resident, by an ICE officer.

The official account of the shooting claims that agents fired in self-defense after Pretti resisted their attempts to disarm him. However, eyewitness accounts, including that of a 29-year-old licensed pediatrician, contradict this claim, stating that Pretti was unarmed and that the agents did not provide medical assistance after the shooting.

The killings have sparked widespread outrage and protests in the city, with community leaders and residents demanding justice and accountability. The situation has also drawn attention from state-level politicians, with Governor Tim Walz urging President Trump to withdraw the ICE agents from Minnesota.

### Community Response
The community response to the killings has been swift and decisive. Volunteers at Calvary Baptist Church have been providing aid and support to those affected, while protesters have taken to the streets, calling for an end to the ICE operation and the removal of the agents from the city. The ACLU of Minnesota and national ACLU have issued a joint statement, demanding that Congress take action to rein in ICE and prevent further violence.

### Demands for Change
Community leaders and residents are demanding several key changes, including:
* The immediate withdrawal of all ICE/Border-Patrol agents from Minneapolis
* Independent, civilian-led investigations of every federal-agent shooting
* Protection of First-Amendment protest rights
* Economic relief for neighborhoods hit by the federal presence

### Conclusion
The situation in Minneapolis is dire, with two U.S. citizens killed by federal immigration agents in a matter of weeks. The community is demanding justice, accountability, and change, and it remains to be seen how the city and state will respond to these demands.
