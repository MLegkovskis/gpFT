**Top Fed officials warn the central bank must not become complacent on inflation** – despite a modest slowdown in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index to 3.4 % year‑on‑year in May, senior policymakers stressed that price pressures remain “elevated enough to merit caution”. In remarks spanning the Federal Open Market Committee’s June 12 meeting, the Board of Governors and regional presidents warned that any premature easing of the benchmark federal‑funds rate, now held at 5.25‑5.50 %, could jeopardise the path to the 2 % target and reignite wage‑price spirals.

## Inflation trajectory and policy stance  

The Fed’s preferred gauge, the PCE index, fell to 2.7 % annual growth in April and 3.4 % in May, while core PCE – excluding food and energy – is projected at 2.8 % by year‑end, up 0.2 percentage points from the March forecast. Chairman Jerome Powell described the recent data as “better than almost anyone expected”, yet reiterated that “greater confidence” is required before any rate cuts. The June Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) reduced the expected number of cuts in 2024 from three to one, reflecting the Committee’s heightened inflation outlook.

## Voices of caution  

Governor Christopher Waller warned that “several more months of good inflation data” are needed before he would support a reduction in rates, implying a core‑inflation threshold of 0.2 % month‑on‑month or lower. New York Fed President John Williams echoed the sentiment, noting that “the labour market remains tight and wage growth is still a concern”, and that “rates may need to stay restrictive for longer”. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, speaking to Bloomberg TV, called the latest CPI report a “great gift” but cautioned that inflation “is still too high and likely won’t reach the 2 % target until 2026”.

## Labour market dynamics  

Employment data underscore the inflation risk. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 272,000 jobs added in May, with the unemployment rate holding at 3.6 %. Real wages have risen modestly, but the combination of low unemployment and solid job growth sustains upward pressure on consumer‑price dynamics.

## Global and supply‑side considerations  

Officials also flagged external risks. Ongoing supply‑chain bottlenecks and geopolitical tensions continue to feed through to commodity prices, while trade‑policy uncertainties could amplify cost pressures. These factors reinforce the Committee’s “data‑dependent” stance and the need to avoid a premature policy pivot.

## Outlook  

The Fed’s forward guidance now centres on “modest further progress” toward the 2 % goal, with a median projection of 2.6 % inflation for the end of 2024 and a return to target only by 2026. Until the data consistently demonstrate a sustained decline, the central bank is expected to keep the policy rate at the current restrictive level, signalling that complacency on inflation is not an option.
