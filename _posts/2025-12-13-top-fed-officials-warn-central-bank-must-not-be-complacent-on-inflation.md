**Top Fed Officials Warn Central Bank Must Not Be Complacent on Inflation**

Senior Federal Reserve officials have warned that the central bank cannot afford complacency as inflation eases only marginally and remains above the 2 % target. In remarks to the press and at a recent policy forum, they stressed that the Fed will keep its “inflation‑fighting resolve” intact while balancing the dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.

## Inflation Still Above Target  

The Fed’s preferred gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 3.4 % year‑on‑year in October, a modest decline from 3.7 % in September but still well above the 2 % goal. Core PCE – which excludes food and energy – held at 4.1 % in the same period, indicating persistent price pressure in services and housing.  

> “We have made progress, but the data remind us that inflation is not yet back to target,” said Governor Christopher Waller at a Bloomberg‑hosted event on 12 December.

## Monetary‑Policy Stance  

The Fed’s target federal‑funds rate remains in the 5.25 %–5.50 % band, the highest level since 2007. Minutes from the 23‑24 December meeting, released by the Fed, reveal that policymakers expect to hold rates steady for at least two quarters, with a “data‑dependent” approach to any future adjustments.

## Labour Market Resilience  

Unemployment has edged up to 3.9 % in November, its highest level since early 2022, yet the job‑creation pace remains robust at 210 000 jobs per month on average. Wage growth, a key driver of core inflation, is still running at 4.3 % year‑on‑year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  

## Global Context  

The European Central Bank is expected to keep its deposit rate at 4.0 % in the upcoming meeting, while the Bank of England is projected to maintain the Bank Rate at 5.25 % to curb UK price rises. Reuters and Bloomberg both note that coordinated high‑rate environments are limiting global demand, which could eventually aid the Fed’s disinflation agenda.

## Outlook and Market Reaction  

Financial markets have priced in a roughly 30 % probability of a rate cut at the Fed’s March 2025 meeting, down from 45 % a month earlier. Treasury yields have risen modestly, with the 10‑year note yielding 4.68 % on 13 December.  

Vice‑Chair Philip Jefferson warned that “a premature easing of policy could re‑ignite price pressures,” underscoring the Fed’s willingness to act decisively if inflation proves sticky.  

## Conclusion  

The Fed’s message is unequivocal: while recent data show a gradual slowdown, the central bank will not declare victory until inflation is firmly anchored at 2 %. Policymakers have signalled that any relaxation of monetary tightening will be contingent on sustained declines in core price measures and a clearer trajectory in the labour market.
