**Top Federal Reserve officials warned on 10 December 2025 that the central bank must not become complacent on inflation, stressing the need for continued vigilance despite a recent rate cut and modestly lower price growth.**  

## Inflation Remains Above Target  

The latest data show the Consumer Price Index (CPI) up 3.7 % year‑on‑year in September, while the Fed’s preferred measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, rose to 2.8 % in the same month – still well above the 2 % target. Core PCE, which strips out food and energy, is projected to ease to 2.4 % in 2026, according to the Summary of Economic Projections released after the meeting.  

## Divergent Views Within the Committee  

- **Jerome Powell**, Chair, described the economy as “very unusual”, citing a mix of tariff‑driven goods inflation and a labour market that may be weaker than official figures suggest. He warned that while inflation has moderated, “the risk of a resurgence remains”.  
- **Austan Goolsbee**, President of the Chicago Fed, voted against the 25‑basis‑point cut, arguing that “more data are needed before we can safely lower rates further”.  
- **Beth Hammack**, President of the Cleveland Fed, called for a “slightly more restrictive stance” to ensure inflation is driven firmly back to 2 %.  
- **Anna Paulson**, President of the Philadelphia Fed, signalled greater concern for the labour market than for price pressures, describing the outlook as “somewhat restrictive”.  

Six of the 19 participants registered a “soft dissent”, reflecting a deepening split between those who see inflation as largely tamed and those who perceive lingering price risks.  

## Policy Outlook  

The FOMC voted to lower the federal‑funds target range to 3.50 %–3.75 %, the third cut of the year. The median projection now expects real GDP growth of 2.3 % in 2026, with unemployment stabilising at 4.4 %. Inflation is forecast to fall to 2.4 % by year‑end 2026, but the Committee highlighted “considerable uncertainty” around the trajectory of goods‑price inflation, especially as tariff effects continue to filter through.  

## Market Implications  

Financial markets priced in a modest easing path, with Treasury yields slipping 4–6 bps after the announcement. However, the noted dissent and the explicit warning against complacency have injected caution, prompting analysts to expect only one further 25‑bp cut in early 2026, contingent on clearer evidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path.  

## Bottom Line  

While the Fed has moved to a slightly more accommodative stance, top officials are united in the view that inflation remains a central risk. The emphasis on “vigilance” and the recorded dissent signal that any future rate reductions will be data‑driven, with the dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment guiding a measured, if cautious, policy trajectory.
