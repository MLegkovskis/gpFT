## Top Fed Officials Warn Central Bank Must Not Be Complacent on Inflation  

**Federal Reserve governors and regional bank presidents warned on Thursday that the United States’ central bank cannot afford to become complacent despite the recent moderation in headline inflation, insisting that any resurgence in price pressures would demand a swift policy response to preserve the 2 % target.**  

## Recent Inflation Trends  

* The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index – the Fed’s preferred gauge – rose 3.4 % year‑on‑year in September, down from a peak of 7.1 % in June 2022.  
* Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, fell to 4.0 % in September from 4.6 % a year earlier, marking the first sub‑5 % reading since early 2022.  
* The median projection in the Fed’s November 2023 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) still places core PCE at 2.5 % by the end of 2024, above the 2 % objective.  

## Officials’ Comments  

* **Governor Christopher Waller** (Jackson Hole) said inflation is “moving in the right direction but remains too high,” adding that “the Fed must be ready to act decisively if the data turn.”  
* **President Raphael Bostic** (Atlanta) warned that “persistent supply‑chain frictions and the lingering effects of the Russia‑Ukraine conflict could reignite price pressures.”  
* **Vice‑Chair for Supervision Michael Barr** highlighted the risk of “sticky services inflation” and urged vigilance on wage growth, which has risen 4.3 % YoY in the latest employment cost index.  

## Policy Implications  

The officials’ remarks come ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) December meeting, where the policy rate is expected to stay at the current 5.25‑5.50 % range. The consensus among the 19 voting members, as reflected in the latest minutes, is to adopt a “data‑dependent” stance, with a majority favouring at least one more rate hike if inflation fails to trend below 2.5 % by mid‑2024.  

## Global and Domestic Risks  

* **Geopolitical tensions** – Ongoing sanctions on Russia and supply‑chain disruptions in Eastern Europe continue to pressure energy and commodity markets.  
* **Labour market tightness** – The unemployment rate held at 3.6 % in September, while job openings remain at a 20‑year high, sustaining upward pressure on wages.  
* **Fiscal policy** – Recent infrastructure spending and the extension of certain tax credits could add to demand‑side inflationary forces.  

## Outlook  

While the trajectory of headline inflation suggests a gradual easing, the Fed’s leadership stresses that the underlying dynamics remain fragile. A premature declaration of victory could undermine credibility and destabilise expectations. Consequently, the central bank is likely to maintain a cautious posture, keeping the policy rate elevated until inflation consistently aligns with the 2 % target, thereby safeguarding the broader economic recovery.
