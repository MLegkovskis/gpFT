### EU Tech Sovereignty Push: Implications for Non-EU Firms
The European Union's push for tech sovereignty has significant implications for non-EU tech firms operating in the region. Google has warned against 'erecting walls' in the EU's tech sovereignty push, citing concerns over data-localisation, mandatory sovereign-cloud instances, and preferential treatment for EU-based vendors.

The EU's measures, including a European-preference rule for public procurement and mandatory data-localisation for AI training data, may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and costs for non-EU tech firms. The potential implications of these measures include:
* Tighter regulatory scrutiny and possible 'digital walls'
* Data-localisation and limits on cross-border data flows
* Massive public-sector cloud re-shoring
* 'Sovereignty-as-a-Service' product push
* AI-training data restrictions
* Potential 'European Preference' in public procurement
* Geopolitical leverage and risk of retaliation
* Increased compliance costs

These implications may lead to a bearish outlook for non-EU tech firms operating in the EU, with potential market share erosion and increased costs.
