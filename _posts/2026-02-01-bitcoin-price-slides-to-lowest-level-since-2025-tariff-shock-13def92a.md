### Bitcoin Price Slides to Lowest Level Since 2025 Tariff Shock
The Bitcoin price has dropped to its lowest level since the 2025 tariff shock, hitting $77,020. This represents a 13% decline year-to-date and has erased approximately $120 billion from the global Bitcoin market-cap.

### Market Impact
The price slide has significant implications for companies with large Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy, for example, has seen its Bitcoin holdings decline in value by roughly $3.5 billion. Galaxy Digital has also been affected, with its investment fund exposed to the falling price.

### Economic Implications
The decline in Bitcoin price has negligible direct implications for global GDP, contributing only about 0.01% to world output. However, the corporate-tax base in the United States could shrink by approximately $120 million in 2026 if the price dip leads to fewer realized gains.

### Companies with Material Bitcoin Exposure
Several companies have significant exposure to Bitcoin, including MicroStrategy, Tesla, Coinbase, and Galaxy Digital. The value of their Bitcoin holdings has decreased substantially due to the price slide, affecting their balance sheets and potentially influencing their financing costs and credit ratings.
