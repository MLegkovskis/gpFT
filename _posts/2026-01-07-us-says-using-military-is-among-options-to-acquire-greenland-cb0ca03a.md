**The White House has placed the use of U.S. military force on the table as a possible means of acquiring Greenland, prompting swift rebuke from Danish officials, Greenlandic leaders and a mixed response from Washington’s own lawmakers.** The statement, released on 6 January 2026, declared that “utilising the US military is always an option at the commander‑in‑chief’s disposal,” a line that has reignited debate over Arctic strategy, NATO cohesion and the sovereignty of the self‑governing Danish territory.

In Washington, the administration’s candidness was met with a blend of reassurance and caution. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt framed the remark as part of a broader “range of options” to pursue what President Trump has termed a national‑security priority. Yet senior aide Stephen Miller, speaking to CNN on the same day, sought to downplay any prospect of actual combat, insisting that “nobody is going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.” Democratic Representative Jake Auchincloss (D‑MA) echoed that sentiment, urging the president to “negotiate a deal, not threaten with force.” Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, during a House Armed Services Committee hearing in the summer of 2025, confirmed that contingency plans exist – a routine precaution for any strategic region, but one that underscores the seriousness with which the Pentagon regards the Arctic theatre.

Denmark’s reaction was unequivocal. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned that any U.S. attack on Greenland would “spell the end of NATO,” positioning the issue as a test of the alliance’s integrity rather than a bilateral squabble. Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen called for “certain misunderstandings” to be resolved through diplomatic channels, signalling a preference for negotiation over escalation. The Danish statements, issued on 7 January 2026, reflect deep concern that a unilateral military move would undermine the trans‑Atlantic security architecture that has underpinned European stability since the Cold War.

Greenland’s self‑government, which has exercised internal autonomy since 1979, responded in kind. Premier Múte Bourup Egede, addressing a press conference in Nuuk on 7 January, declared that “we will not be bullied by any foreign power,” and reiterated the demand that the United States “respect the sovereignty of Denmark and Greenland.” With a population of roughly 57 000, Greenland’s political weight is modest, yet its strategic value is outsized by the presence of the Pituffik Space Base – formerly Thule – which operates under a 1951 defence agreement granting the United States extensive access but not sovereignty.

The episode unfolds against a backdrop of heightened U.S. assertiveness in the Western Hemisphere, most recently demonstrated by a high‑profile operation in Venezuela. Analysts note that the Greenland overture may be driven by a desire to secure Arctic resources and to counter Russian activity in the region, yet the overt mention of military options risks eroding the diplomatic goodwill that has long characterised U.S.–Danish relations. For Denmark, the prospect of a NATO fracture is a red line; for Greenland, the issue touches on a long‑standing desire for greater self‑determination and protection from external coercion.

As the debate moves from the White House press room to parliamentary floors and diplomatic corridors, the ultimate outcome will hinge on whether Washington can translate its strategic ambitions into a mutually acceptable arrangement, or whether the spectre of force will prove counter‑productive, alienating both allies and the very territory it seeks to acquire.
