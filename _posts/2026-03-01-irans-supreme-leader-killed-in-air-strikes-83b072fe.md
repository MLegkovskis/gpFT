# Iran's Supreme Leader Killed in Air Strikes
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei was killed in air strikes on February 28, 2026, according to verified sources including Reuters, BBC, and NPR. The strikes, carried out by the United States and Israel, targeted Khamenei's Tehran compound and resulted in the deaths of several senior officials, including Defence Minister Amir Nasirzadeh and IRGC commander Mohammad Pakpour.
## Succession Mechanism
The Assembly of Experts, an elected body of 88 senior clerics, will select the next Supreme Leader. The process is expected to be triggered immediately, with the Assembly meeting behind closed doors to vote on a new leader.
## Potential Candidates
Several potential candidates have been named by analysts, including Ebrahim Raisi, Mohammad-Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi, and Mohammad-Ali Jafari. The IRGC faction is likely to push for a hard-line candidate, while the clerical-political establishment may favor a more moderate figure.
## Power Balance
The simultaneous loss of the Supreme Leader and two top IRGC commanders creates a temporary power vacuum. The IRGC's chain of command is already hierarchical, and the death of Pakpour will be filled by the deputy commander, who is expected to consolidate control over the Guard's ground forces.
## Public Reaction
The public reaction to Khamenei's death has been mixed, with celebrations in several cities and protests in others. This visible split in public sentiment could force the Assembly of Experts to choose a figure who can claim popular legitimacy.
## Potential for Intra-Elite Rivalry
Different factions within the regime may vie for influence in the selection of the next Supreme Leader. Expect behind-the-scenes negotiations between the IRGC, the Office of the Supreme Leader, and the Guardian Council.
## Risk of Further Escalation
Iran launched retaliatory missile and drone strikes on 27 US bases and Israeli sites within 24 hours of Khamenei's death. The new Supreme Leader will inherit a heightened war footing, limiting diplomatic flexibility.
