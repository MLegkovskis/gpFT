### The Collapse of the FCAS Programme
The €100bn Franco-German Future Combat Air System (FCAS) programme is on the brink of collapse due to a dispute between Dassault and Airbus over leadership and intellectual property. The programme, which was launched in 2017, aims to develop a next-generation fighter jet and a swarm-drone system. However, the dispute between the two companies has led to a deadlock, with Dassault wanting full control of the programme and Airbus seeking a 50% share of design and technology.

### Geopolitical Implications
The collapse of the FCAS programme could have significant geopolitical implications. The erosion of Franco-German strategic cohesion could weaken the political engine that underpins EU defence integration. The delay in Europe's sixth-generation air combat capability could also widen the gap with the US and China, which are already operational. Furthermore, the loss of the €100bn industrial base and jobs could lead to a European defence-industry shock, triggering plant closures and a drop in EU aerospace R&D spending.

### Shift in NATO Burden-Sharing
The collapse of the FCAS programme could also lead to a shift in NATO burden-sharing, with the US shouldering a larger share of the cost. This could potentially prompt a re-assessment of the 2% GDP defence-spending target for European members. The failure of the programme could also give rival powers, such as China and Russia, more diplomatic leverage in security dialogues.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the collapse of the FCAS programme would have significant geopolitical implications, including the erosion of Franco-German strategic cohesion, delay in Europe's sixth-generation air combat capability, and increased reliance on non-European suppliers. The failure of the programme could also lead to a shift in NATO burden-sharing and give rival powers more diplomatic leverage in security dialogues.
