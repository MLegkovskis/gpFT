**London’s private‑members’ clubs are booming, yet they stubbornly reject the word “club” – a paradox that underpins a £1.5 bn annual turnover and a 0.2 % slice of the capital’s GDP.**  

The city now hosts more than 133 private‑members’ venues – the highest concentration in the United Kingdom – a figure that has swelled faster in the past four years than in the three decades following the 1985 launch of the Groucho Club【Observer】.  Knight Frank estimates the sector’s combined revenue at roughly £1.5 billion (about $1.9 bn) in 2024, translating to around 0.2 % of London’s £800 bn gross domestic product【City AM】.  While modest in macro‑economic terms, the market rivals other niche luxury‑service industries such as high‑end art fairs and boutique fashion houses.

Growth is being driven by a diversification of concepts.  Traditional hospitality is being blended with wellness, co‑working and hybrid hotel‑club models, creating high‑margin, non‑room revenue streams.  The sector’s dynamism is evident in flagship operators.  Soho House posted $288.9 million in revenue for Q2 2023 – a 19 % year‑on‑year increase – with membership fees accounting for 31 % of that total【RLA Global】.  Annabel’s, a long‑standing London institution, reportedly draws £100 million a year from membership fees alone, based on an estimated 30 000 members paying an average of £3 250【Undervalued Shares】.  These two clubs together represent a sizeable proportion of the £1.5 bn pie, underscoring the importance of elite membership income.

London’s dominance is reinforced by its position within Europe’s private‑members’ club market, valued at US $10.4 bn in 2024, with the capital identified as the continent’s largest hub【Dataintelo】.  Globally, the market is projected to reach US $25.8 bn by 2027, expanding at an 11 % compound annual growth rate【Knight Frank】.  If this trajectory holds, London’s revenue could climb to roughly £2 bn by 2027, nudging its GDP contribution toward 0.25 % of the capital’s economy.

The reluctance to be called “clubs” is rooted in a heritage that dates back to 18th‑century gentlemen’s societies, where exclusivity and discretion were paramount.  Modern operators preserve this ethos while courting a new generation of affluent professionals who value curated experiences over conventional nightlife.  The result is a sector that is both a custodian of tradition and a catalyst for contemporary luxury consumption.

In sum, London’s private‑members’ establishments have evolved from historic enclaves into a high‑growth, revenue‑rich segment of the city’s service economy.  Their contribution—£1.5 bn in annual turnover and a measurable impact on GDP—signals that, despite the semantic aversion, they are an increasingly visible force shaping the capital’s social and economic landscape.
