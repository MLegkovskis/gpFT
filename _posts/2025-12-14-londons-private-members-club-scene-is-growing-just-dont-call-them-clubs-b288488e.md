**London’s private members’ club scene is growing. Just don’t call them clubs**

London’s private‑members’ venues have surged in the past five years, expanding from roughly 210 clubs to 260 – a 24 % rise – and delivering around £90 million in business‑rates and VAT receipts while supporting about 1,200 full‑time jobs. The boom is reshaping the city’s hospitality landscape, prompting both praise for its economic stimulus and warning about widening social divides.

Industry consultants point to a “wave‑front of new, boutique‑style clubs” that marry traditional service with modern experiential concepts. Younger, affluent professionals are drawn to spaces that promise privacy, curated events and a blend of historic ambience with cutting‑edge design. Average annual membership fees for these new venues sit between £1,800 and £2,500, reflecting the premium placed on exclusivity without the rigid formality of older gentlemen’s clubs.

Politicians are split on the phenomenon. The mayor celebrates the sector’s contribution to jobs and London’s global reputation, while the shadow housing secretary warns that ultra‑exclusive venues deepen the city’s segregation. Conservative councillors, however, stress the clubs’ role in urban regeneration, noting how repurposed Georgian townhouses now host vibrant, heritage‑preserving hubs that attract high‑spending visitors and generate £45 million in annual tax receipts for Westminster alone.

Beyond the balance sheet, the clubs are evolving into multifunctional social salons. Modern spaces such as The Vault, Mortimer House and The Twenty Two combine co‑working areas, 24‑hour gyms, rooftop pools and on‑site accommodation, positioning themselves as hybrid work‑leisure destinations. Membership now signals cultural alignment – creativity, sustainability and inclusivity – rather than hereditary class. Women enjoy full access, and many clubs maintain gender‑balanced rosters and host women‑focused programmes, a stark contrast to the male‑only sanctuaries of the 18th‑ and 19th‑centuries.

Historic gentlemen’s clubs were founded in the 17th and 18th centuries, with institutions like White’s (1693) and Brooks’s (1764) serving as aristocratic refuges where a single black ball could reject a candidate. Membership was limited to a few hundred, fees were modest by today’s standards and the purpose was chiefly social refuge, gambling and discreet political networking. Communication was face‑to‑face, and clubs were clustered in St James’s.

Today’s private‑members’ venues are commercially run, digitally enabled and globally networked. Apps allow members to book rooms, order food and access reciprocal clubs in 75 cities worldwide. Membership numbers have exploded: Soho House alone counts over 100 000 members globally, with roughly 30 000 based in London, while newer entrants report thousands of members within their first year. Fees have risen to £1 200‑£2 200 annually, often accompanied by joining charges, reflecting the premium placed on curated experiences.

The sector’s rapid expansion is reshaping London’s social fabric. On one hand, it fuels economic growth, revitalises heritage buildings and creates a new class of cultural hubs that cater to the city’s creative elite. On the other, critics argue that the proliferation of ultra‑exclusive venues reinforces a two‑tiered society, where privilege is signalled through access to private spaces that operate beyond public scrutiny. As the city grapples with housing pressures and inequality, the private‑members’ club boom will remain a flashpoint in debates over London’s future identity.
