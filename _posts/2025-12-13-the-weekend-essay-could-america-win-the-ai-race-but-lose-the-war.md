**The Weekend Essay. Could America win the AI race but lose the war?**
=================================================================

**A U.S. victory in the AI race would lock in a large share of a $15 trillion-plus global AI market**, reinforcing the country’s export-led growth model, with the potential to add more than $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030, as projected by [Science & Tech Action – AI and America’s Future](https://sciencetechaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AI-and-Americas-Future-Final_13025.pdf). However, this dominance also creates new vulnerabilities, including energy dependence, trade disputes, and the danger of an AI-driven security dilemma.

The potential economic implications of a U.S. victory in the AI race are substantial, with North America expected to capture approximately 14.5% of global AI-driven GDP growth by 2030, according to [Bank of America – AI Impact on the Global Economy](https://www.privatebank.bankofamerica.com/articles/economic-impact-of-ai.html). The U.S. is also expected to account for more than 75% of reported private VC investment in generative-AI startups, as reported by [Federal Reserve – State of AI Competition](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-state-of-ai-competition-in-advanced-economies-20251006.html).

The U.S. is pushing for "AI-aligned alliances" to lock in shared governance frameworks, with the White House AI Action Plan aiming to promote the use of trustworthy artificial intelligence in the federal government, as stated in [White House – America's AI Action Plan (July 2025)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf). However, the risk of "AI-enabled warfare" and the potential for autonomous weapons to lower the threshold for conflict also exists, as highlighted by the *The Weekend Essay*.

Historical technological advancements, such as the space race, have informed U.S. policy and strategy in the AI sector. The space race experience has provided valuable lessons, including the importance of setting bold, time-bound national goals, massive sustained federal investment, cross-agency coordination, and public-private partnerships. The U.S. is now applying these lessons to the AI race, with a focus on winning the "power race" to ensure sustained AI superiority.

The National AI Initiative Act (2020) has established a National AI Coordination Office, authorized $2.5 billion for AI research (FY 2022-2025), and created 10 AI research institutes. The U.S. is also investing in AI education, with the AI Education Act (2022) funding $500 million for AI curricula in community colleges. However, the U.S. must balance openness with security, particularly with regards to export controls, to avoid stifling innovation.

In conclusion, a U.S. victory in the AI race would have significant economic and geopolitical implications, with the potential to lock in a large share of the global AI market and reinforce the country's export-led growth model. However, this dominance also creates new vulnerabilities, and the U.S. must prioritize coordinated policy across industry, government, and allies to ensure sustained AI superiority.
