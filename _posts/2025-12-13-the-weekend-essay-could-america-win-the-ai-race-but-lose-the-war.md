**The United States may be ahead in developing cutting‑edge artificial‑intelligence models, but analysts warn that without a coordinated strategy it could cede strategic advantage to rivals, particularly China, and find its technological supremacy undermined by dependence on foreign supply chains and standards.**  

## The State of the Race  
In 2024 the United States allocated **$2.7 billion** to the American AI Initiative, funding university labs, federal R&D and the National AI Research Institutes. Private‑sector spend added another **$37 billion** in enterprise AI, with generative‑AI revenues climbing from **$1.7 billion** in 2023 to **$37 billion** in 2025, according to Menlo Ventures. By contrast, Beijing’s 2024 budget earmarked **over $10 billion** for AI, and the Chinese government has set a target of **$30 billion** in AI‑related investment by 2027, backed by state‑led talent programmes and the “New Generation AI Development Plan”.  

## Market Size and Growth Trajectories  
Global AI market valuation reached **$638 billion** in 2024 and is projected to exceed **$3.7 trillion** by 2034, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of **19.2 %** (Precedence Research). The United States accounts for roughly **$146 billion** of that 2024 total, expected to rise to **$851 billion** by 2034 (CAGR 19.3 %). Meanwhile, the generative‑AI segment alone is forecast to grow at **29 % CAGR**, reaching **$220 billion** by 2030 (ABI Research).  

## Strategic Risks  
1. **Supply‑chain vulnerability** – More than half of the world’s advanced AI chips are produced in Taiwan and South Korea, while Chinese firms dominate AI‑optimised silicon. A disruption could force U.S. data‑centres to rely on foreign hardware, exposing critical infrastructure to geopolitical pressure.  
2. **Standards capture** – International bodies such as ISO and the IEEE are already drafting AI governance frameworks. China’s early engagement risks shaping norms around data localisation, algorithmic opacity and export controls that could limit U.S. firms’ market access.  
3. **Talent drain** – The OECD reports that 42 % of AI PhDs from U.S. universities accepted positions abroad in 2023, many in Chinese or Singaporean labs offering competitive packages and fewer regulatory constraints.  

## Towards a Comprehensive Policy  
The White House’s 2024 AI Blueprint calls for a “national AI ecosystem” encompassing research, talent pipelines, and export‑control reforms, but critics argue it lacks enforcement mechanisms. A robust approach would require:  

* **Coordinated industrial policy** – Direct subsidies for domestic chip fabs, akin to the CHIPS Act, coupled with tax incentives for AI‑focused SMEs.  
* **Strategic standards participation** – Expanded U.S. representation in global standards committees, ensuring transparency and alignment with democratic values.  
* **Talent retention programmes** – Visa reforms, research grants and public‑private fellowships targeting under‑represented groups to broaden the domestic talent pool.  

## The Bottom Line  
Winning the AI race in terms of model performance and market share will not guarantee strategic security. Without decisive action to secure supply chains, shape standards and retain talent, the United States risks winning a sprint while losing the marathon for long‑term technological dominance.
