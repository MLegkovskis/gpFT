**Carney’s fossil fuel pivot bewilders climate experts and business leaders**

*Mark Carney, once hailed as a “climate‑change warrior” for warning that fossil‑fuel assets could become a “carbon bubble”, has now turned the same platform into a defence of new oil and gas projects – a reversal that has left investors, NGOs and policy‑makers scrambling for a new narrative.*  

During his tenure as Bank of England governor (2013‑2020) Carney warned that **up to one‑third of known fossil‑fuel reserves must stay in the ground** to meet the 2 °C target and that the financial system could lose **1‑3 % of global GDP** if stranded‑asset risk materialised【Financial Stability Board, 2015】. He urged regulators to introduce **climate‑risk stress‑tests** and to price carbon correctly, famously stating that “the value of fossil‑fuel assets could become worthless”【Lloyd’s speech, 2015】. Those pronouncements earned him the nickname “climate‑change warrior” among central bankers and the **Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)** cited his “tragedy of the horizon” as a catalyst for global climate‑risk disclosure【NGFS, 2019】.

Since becoming Prime Minister of Canada in 2024, Carney’s rhetoric has shifted dramatically. He now describes fossil‑fuel production as **“cleaner”** than many overseas competitors and argues that **carbon‑capture and storage (CCS)** will allow continued expansion of oil and gas【Energy Connects, 2025】. In policy terms, his government **scrapped the consumer carbon tax** of roughly **$65 / tonne CO₂** and introduced a **$1.2 billion tax deduction** for LNG projects, while approving a **30 % capacity increase** at the LNG Canada export terminal and launching a feasibility study for a new West‑Coast oil pipeline【WSJ, 2025】【FT, 2025】. No comparable quantitative risk assessment accompanies these incentives.

The contrast is stark. Where Carney once quantified climate risk – warning that **33 %** of reserves would need to stay buried and that asset values could evaporate – his current agenda offers **fiscal carrots** without a parallel risk narrative. The shift from **regulatory stress‑testing and carbon pricing** to **deregulation and project approval** has drawn sharp criticism. Climate NGOs such as **Friends of the Earth** and the **Wilderness Committee** have called the pivot “bewildering” and warned it “undermines the credibility of the 2021‑2025 climate‑finance agenda”【Wilderness Committee, 2025】. Even within the climate‑finance community, the earlier praise has turned to scepticism, with analysts noting that Carney’s present stance “creates a contradiction between past warnings and present actions”【FT, 2025】.

For investors, the message is ambiguous. The **$1.2 bn** incentive for LNG may boost short‑term project pipelines, but the removal of the **$65 / t CO₂** carbon tax could erode the price signal that underpinned recent moves toward greener portfolios. Meanwhile, the absence of a quantified stranded‑asset risk leaves markets without a clear gauge of potential losses, reviving the very “tragedy of the horizon” Carney once warned about.

In sum, Carney’s evolution from a regulator warning of a **carbon bubble** to a prime minister championing **cleaner fossil fuels** represents a **quantitative, qualitative and policy reversal** that has left climate experts and business leaders alike searching for a new compass.
