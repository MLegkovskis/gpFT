# Iranian Students Mount Further Anti-Regime Protests
The Iranian authorities have responded to the renewed student protests with an intensified security crackdown. The regime has framed the grievances as foreign-instigated unrest and has not announced any concrete economic or political concessions.
## Response of Iranian Authorities
The authorities have imposed a nationwide crackdown on anti-government protests, resulting in a significant number of deaths and arrests. The regime has also imposed a full internet blackout and a night-time curfew in major cities.
## Measures to Address Student Grievances
The authorities claim to have acknowledged economic grievances, but have not announced any substantive policy changes. Instead, they have focused on a security-focused solution, including the deployment of paramilitary forces and the imposition of curfew and internet shutdown.
## Key Quantitative Snapshot

* Independent counts: >7,000 killed
* Arrests since the January crackdown: >5,000
