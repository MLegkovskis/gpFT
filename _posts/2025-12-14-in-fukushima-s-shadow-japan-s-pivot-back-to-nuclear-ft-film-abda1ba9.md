**Japan’s energy elite are rallying behind a nuclear revival, touting massive import‑cost cuts and carbon‑reduction gains, even as lingering Fukushima trauma and steep safety upgrades threaten to stall the plan.**  

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida set the tone in July 2022, pledging to “maximise the use of existing nuclear power plants, accelerate restarts and extend operating licences” as part of his GX Implementation Council plan【World Nuclear Report】. The promise is simple: slash the ¥10.7 trn (US$71 bn) annual LNG‑and‑coal import bill and keep Japan on track for its 2030 carbon‑neutrality target. His successor, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, echoed the message in October 2025, adding a political‑communication twist – “proceed with nuclear restarts while taking concrete steps to gain the necessary understanding of local communities and stakeholders”【Reuters (Oct 2025)】. Both leaders frame nuclear as a national‑security lever that can tame inflation‑driven fuel‑price pressure.

The private sector is equally vocal. TEPCO’s chief, Tatsuo Kobayashi, warned in March 2024 that without restarts “Japan must restart nuclear plants if we are to meet our 2030 climate‑change commitments and keep electricity affordable”【Reuters (Mar 2024)】. He quantifies the upside as a ¥2–3 bn annual reduction in wholesale power prices, but flags a ¥1 trn safety‑upgrade bill and a deep public‑trust deficit. JERA’s CEO Toshihiko Higashikuni went further in April 2024, calling nuclear “the key to decarbonisation” and insisting it will lock in low‑carbon baseload for its 30 GW portfolio while cutting imported LNG, which makes up roughly 30 % of its fuel mix【Reuters (Apr 2024)】. The downside, he admits, is the ¥15 trn capital cost of a 1 GW small‑modular reactor and market‑price reforms that could render nuclear uneconomic.

Heavy‑industry sees a different angle. Japan Steel Works (JSW) president Masahiko Kobayashi told a May 2024 round‑table that a nuclear revival would boost steel orders for reactor pressure vessels by 5 % by 2027, reviving a sector that has been shrinking since 2011【Nippon.com】. Yet long lead‑times of 8‑10 years for component certification and competition from Chinese firms remain a concern. The business lobby Keidanren backs a 20 % nuclear share by 2040, projecting ¥3 trn annual fuel‑import savings and 1.2 million jobs in the supply chain, but warns that regulatory delays could derail the target【NucNet】.

Public sentiment is mixed. A December 2025 Jiji Press poll shows 44.7 % support for restarts, 26.1 % opposition and 29.2 % undecided, with strongest resistance among supporters of the Constitutional Democratic Party and the Japanese Communist Party【Sightline】. Environmental NGOs, notably Greenpeace Japan, argue that the policy “ignores the long‑term waste‑management burden” and undermines trust, pointing to a ¥2 trn cost for a national high‑level repository and suggesting renewables plus storage could meet 50 % of demand by 2035 without nuclear【BBC】.

Economically, the nuclear pivot is projected to add roughly ¥10‑15 trn (US$70‑100 bn) to GDP over FY 2025‑26 – about 0.2‑0.3 percentage points of annual growth – by saving ¥90 bn a year on fossil‑fuel imports and generating multiplier effects【IEEJ】. In constant‑currency terms this boost equals 1‑2 % of Japan’s 2010 pre‑Fukushima nominal GDP of US$5.5 trn, a modest but politically useful lift.

**Bottom line:** Japan’s leadership and energy‑intensive firms are betting that nuclear can deliver energy security, cost savings and decarbonisation, but the gamble hinges on overcoming safety certification, waste‑management financing and a public still scarred by Fukushima. The success of the 20 % nuclear‑by‑2040 target will be measured not just in megawatts, but in whether the country can reconcile these competing forces.
