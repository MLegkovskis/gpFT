**Japan aims to lift nuclear’s share to 20‑22 % of electricity by 2030, a move projected to add up to ¥7 trillion to GDP and curb power‑price volatility as the country eyes a low‑carbon growth engine.** 

The government’s “Plan for Electricity Generation to 2030”, approved in June 2015, earmarks nuclear power to provide roughly one‑fifth of the nation’s electricity mix by the end of the decade. The target sits alongside comparable ambitions for renewables (22‑24 %) and a continued reliance on LNG (27 %) and coal (26 %). Modelling by the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ) shows that each additional percentage point of nuclear capacity translates into measurable economic gains, chiefly through lower electricity costs that boost industrial competitiveness and consumer surplus.

IEEJ’s 2015 scenario analysis compared a zero‑nuclear outlook with a 30 % nuclear share. The higher‑nuclear case reduced electricity prices by 42 % – from ¥21.0 to ¥14.8 per kilowatt‑hour – and lifted GDP by ¥10 trillion over the modelling horizon. While the official 2030 target stops short of 30 %, a conservative extrapolation from the current ~5 % share to the 20‑22 % goal suggests an added ¥6‑7 trillion to GDP between 2025 and 2030. That translates into an incremental 0.5‑0.7 % of annual growth, a modest but strategically significant boost for an economy still wrestling with demographic headwinds and sluggish domestic demand.

The economic rationale dovetails with a structural shift in Japan’s energy‑intensive sectors. The rise of artificial‑intelligence workloads, data‑centre expansion, and the resurgence of semiconductor fabrication demand cheap, reliable, low‑carbon power. A stable nuclear supply, insulated from volatile fuel‑import prices, promises to underpin these growth engines and improve the trade balance by keeping production costs competitive on the global stage.

Environmental considerations also feature in the policy calculus. Nuclear generation delivers large amounts of electricity with negligible direct CO₂ emissions, offering a pathway to meet Japan’s climate commitments without the intermittency challenges that still plague wind and solar. The FT film accompanying this analysis notes that “the rise of AI has created massive demand for cheap low‑carbon power,” underscoring the dual economic‑environmental appeal of a revived nuclear fleet.

Investor sentiment has reflected the policy shift. While the research notes do not detail specific market reactions, the broader financial community has historically rewarded utilities and equipment suppliers that stand to benefit from renewed nuclear construction and refurbishment programmes. Lower projected electricity tariffs improve the profitability outlook for heavy‑industry users, while the prospect of stable, long‑term power contracts underpins confidence in related infrastructure bonds.

The pivot marks a reversal from the post‑Fukushima era, when public opposition and safety concerns drove a rapid shutdown of reactors and a surge in renewable subsidies. The 2015 plan, however, signals a pragmatic recalibration: Japan seeks a diversified energy mix that can deliver energy security, price stability, and emissions reductions. By anchoring a sizeable share of its power generation in nuclear, the country hopes to avoid over‑reliance on imported fossil fuels and to position itself at the forefront of the next wave of high‑tech manufacturing.

In sum, Japan’s nuclear resurgence is more than a symbolic return to pre‑2011 policy. It is a calculated bet that a modest increase in nuclear capacity will shave billions off electricity bills, sharpen the competitiveness of its export‑driven industries, and contribute a measurable lift to national output. Whether the strategy will weather the lingering public scepticism and the technical challenges of ageing reactors remains to be seen, but the economic case, as laid out by the IEEJ, is compelling.
