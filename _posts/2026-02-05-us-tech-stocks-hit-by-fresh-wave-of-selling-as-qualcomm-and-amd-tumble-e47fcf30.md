# US Tech Stocks Hit by Fresh Wave of Selling
The US tech sector has been hit by a fresh wave of selling, with Qualcomm and AMD being the hardest hit. Qualcomm warned that its revenue and profit would fall short of Wall Street estimates, resulting in a 15.2% decline in its stock price. Similarly, AMD's stock price plummeted by 17.3% despite a 34% year-over-year rise in Q4 revenue, due to a cautious AI-chip revenue outlook.
## Core Drivers of the Decline
The decline in these tech stocks can be attributed to several factors, including:
* Memory-chip shortages and higher component costs
* Revenue-forecast misses
* AI-chip growth uncertainty
* Elevated investor expectations
* Competitive pressure and inventory constraints
## Expected Impact on the US Tech Sector
The sell-off in Qualcomm and AMD stocks is expected to have a broader impact on the US tech sector, including:
* A sector-wide rotation from high-growth semiconductor names to more defensive or value-oriented stocks
* AI-chip valuation pressure, with price-to-sales multiples likely to be compressed for other AI-focused chipmakers
* Earnings-forecast volatility, with analysts tightening consensus estimates for the whole semiconductor segment
* A focus on supply-chain risk, with investors favoring companies with diversified product mixes
* A potential broader tech pull-back, with the S&P 500's tech weighting likely to keep the index under pressure
