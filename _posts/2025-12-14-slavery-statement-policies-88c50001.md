**Modern‑slavery profits have surged from a conservative US $44 bn in 2005 to at least US $245 bn in 2021 – a five‑fold rise that now represents roughly 0.26 % of global GDP, prompting investors, CEOs and regulators to tighten disclosure rules and threaten valuation penalties for weak statements.**  

The International Labour Organisation’s early estimate placed illicit profits at US $44 bn (≈ 0.03 % of world GDP) in 2005 【ILO 2005】. A decade later the figure jumped to US $150 bn (≈ 0.11 % of GDP) 【ILO 2014】, and Hope for Justice’s 2023 update put the 2021 profit pool at a “conservative” US $245 bn – 0.26 % of the US $94.9 trillion global economy 【Hope for Justice 2023】. The breakdown attributes US $169.9 bn to sexual exploitation and US $75.9 bn to forced labour in the private sector, while explicitly excluding forced marriage and state‑imposed labour, suggesting the true cost is even higher.

Investor giants are already quantifying the risk. BlackRock warned that firms with inadequate modern‑slavery metrics could see **≥ 5 % lower valuation multiples** over the next year 【Reuters BlackRock 2024】. Vanguard’s stewardship report linked a **+2 %** share‑price bump to firms that upgraded their statements in early 2024 【Reuters Vanguard 2024】, whereas State Street’s proxy‑voting guidance flags “red‑flag” disclosures, which have correlated with a **‑3.8 %** six‑month return for affected FTSE 250 companies 【FT via Reuters 2024】. IFM Investors note that companies with comprehensive policies out‑performed the MSCI World Index by **1.4 %** annually between 2021‑2024 【IFM 2025】.

Corporate leaders are echoing the same urgency. Unilever’s Alan Jope described modern slavery as “against everything we stand for” after a child‑labour scandal 【ETI Unilever 2024】, while Tesco’s Ken Murphy announced that its new slavery statement now covers **100 % of Tier‑1 and Tier‑2 suppliers**, up from 68 % in 2022 【ETI Tesco 2024】. Across the Atlantic, Amazon pledged 100 % of Tier‑1 suppliers to complete anti‑slavery training in 2024 【Amazon 2024】, and Databricks added a blanket prohibition on trafficking and forced labour to its 2024 policy 【Databricks 2024】.

Governments are moving from guidance to mandatory enforcement. The UK Home Office’s March 2024 consultation proposes **mandatory third‑party verification** for all modern‑slavery statements, estimating compliance costs of **£1.2 bn** for FTSE 100 firms 【Gov.uk 2024】. The EU Commission’s April 2024 proposal will, from 2027, require listed companies to disclose forced‑labour exposure in financial portfolios, with fines of up to **€10 m** for non‑compliance 【EU Commission 2024】. Australia’s ASIC is preparing civil penalties of up to **A$5 m** per breach, after flagging 12 % of listed firms for incomplete statements in 2023‑24 【ASIC 2024】.

The modern‑slavery statement thus sits at the intersection of historic abolitionist ideals and a dense web of international law. The language of today’s corporate policies – “free from slavery and human trafficking” – mirrors the universal prohibition first enshrined in the 1948 UDHR and the 13th Amendment of the US Constitution. By citing the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, California’s Transparency in Supply Chains Act 2010 and ILO conventions, firms are aligning their disclosures with the same multilateral treaties that emerged from 19th‑century abolitionist campaigns.  

**Bottom line:** As illicit profits climb and regulatory pressure intensifies, companies that fail to produce robust, third‑party‑verified slavery statements risk immediate market penalties, while those that embrace full‑supply‑chain transparency are poised to capture a modest valuation premium and avoid costly fines.
