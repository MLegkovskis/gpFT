**Modern‑slavery profits have surged to an estimated US $236 billion, now representing roughly 0.26 % of global GDP – a stark rise from the US $150 billion (0.14 % of GDP) recorded a decade earlier – and multinational corporations are responding with sweeping slavery statements that echo the moral language of 19th‑century abolitionists while anchoring themselves in contemporary human‑rights law.** 

The International Labour Organization’s latest global estimate shows that forced labour and forced sexual exploitation now generate annual profits of US $236 billion, a 57 % increase over the US $150 billion reported in 2014. The share of world output has effectively doubled, underscoring a widening economic distortion that benefits firms willing to tolerate coerced work. The ILO attributes this growth to a higher prevalence of modern slavery – about 50 million victims in 2024, up from roughly 40 million in 2012 – and to the inclusion of forced sexual exploitation in its methodology. 

In parallel, the corporate sector is producing the first generation of modern‑slavery statements mandated by legislation such as the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, Australia’s 2018 Act, Canada’s 2023 Bill C‑8 and California’s 2010 Transparency in Supply Chains Act. Leading firms – Milliken, Amazon and Databricks – have published detailed disclosures that translate legal obligations into measurable actions. Milliken’s policy commits to auditing more than 1 200 suppliers, targeting 100 % coverage of high‑risk vendors by 2025. Amazon reports training over 250 000 employees in seven languages and a partnership with Truckers Against Trafficking that has equipped more than 5 000 drivers with anti‑trafficking awareness. Databricks has instituted a board‑approved anti‑slavery policy, risk‑assessing all 400 of its third‑party vendors and pledging zero forced‑labour incidents by 2026. Collectively these statements cover roughly four million employees and three million suppliers, each referencing at least two core international instruments such as the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 4) and ILO Conventions 29 and 105. 

The language of today’s statements is a direct descendant of historic abolitionist campaigns. The 1807 British Slave‑Trade Act, which banned the commerce in enslaved people, finds its modern echo in supplier‑audit clauses that prohibit sourcing from “human‑trafficking routes”. The moral condemnation articulated by William Lloyd Garrison’s *Liberator* in 1831 – “the sin of slavery” – is mirrored in zero‑tolerance clauses that categorise any form of ownership over persons as a breach of corporate ethics. The 1863 Emancipation Proclamation’s use of executive authority to end slavery is reflected in state‑driven disclosure regimes that compel firms to publish annual statements. Moreover, the 1833 British Slavery Abolition Act’s critique of “apprenticeship” as a coercive labour regime resonates with today’s focus on forced‑labour definitions drawn from ILO Convention 29, which describes work extracted under threat of penalty and without consent. 

International human‑rights instruments provide the legal scaffolding for these corporate policies. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights establishes the baseline prohibition of slavery, while the 1930 ILO Forced Labour Convention and the 1957 ILO Abolition of Forced Labour Convention obligate states – and by extension their corporate actors – to eradicate coerced work. The 2000 Palermo Protocol supplies the definition of human trafficking that underpins reporting lines and victim‑support mechanisms, such as Amazon’s hot‑line and safe‑housing initiatives. Child‑labour safeguards trace their lineage to 19th‑century factory‑act reforms, now codified in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and ILO Convention 138, and are reflected in Amazon’s monitoring of two million SKUs for child‑labour risks. 

The convergence of economic data, legislative pressure and historical moral imperatives signals a decisive shift: modern‑slavery statements are no longer perfunctory disclosures but strategic tools that align profit motives with the abolitionist goal of total eradication of ownership‑based exploitation. As the financial impact of forced labour swells, investors and CEOs alike are betting that transparent, rights‑based supply‑chain governance will become a competitive differentiator, while governments prepare to tighten reporting standards in line with the growing evidence of profit‑driven human exploitation.
