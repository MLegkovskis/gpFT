**Trump assault opens EU rift as leaders split on US strategy**

The publication of President Donald Trump’s new National‑Security Strategy on 5 December 2025 – accompanied by a televised “push” on an EU official in Brussels – has ignited a sharp diplomatic fissure within the European Union. European leaders denounced the physical aggression as “unacceptable” and the strategy itself as a “worrying shift away from the transatlantic partnership.” The episode has already translated into market turbulence, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring to a record‑closing high before retreating, while the FTSE 100 posted a modest gain on the first full trading day after the announcement.

U.S. equities reacted with textbook volatility. On 11 December the Dow closed at 48 704.01, up 1.34 % – a gain of roughly 650 points that set a new record. The next session saw a pull‑back of 0.51 % to 48 458.05, a swing that underscored investors’ sensitivity to geopolitical risk. Across the Channel, the FTSE 100 rose 0.49 % to 9 703.16, its strongest one‑day increase since late November, suggesting that European investors initially absorbed the news with a defensive tilt toward energy and consumer‑staple stocks.

The political fallout is equally stark. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen condemned Trump’s “physical aggression” as “unacceptable” and warned that the United States’ new strategy “marks a worrying shift away from the transatlantic partnership.” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz echoed the sentiment, stating that “we cannot condone any form of violence, especially from a leader who claims to champion democracy,” and insisting that the United States must “respect the sovereignty of its allies.” European Council President Antonio Costa added that the strategy could “embolden extremist forces in Europe” and called for Washington to “re‑engage as a true partner.” The split among member states is palpable: twelve of the twenty‑seven EU countries defended Trump’s stance, while fifteen issued condemnations, a division that has already delayed EU‑US trade talks slated for early 2026.

Comparisons with the diplomatic rift that followed the 2003 Iraq invasion highlight both continuities and divergences. In both episodes, unilateral U.S. actions – the 2003 decision to invade without a UN resolution and the 2025 National Security Strategy that labelled Europe a “burden” – provoked strong European opposition. Public opinion mirrors the earlier crisis: a 2003 IFOP poll found 71 % of French respondents opposed the Iraq war, while a European Commission poll released on 10 December 2025 shows 68 % of Europeans believing the United States is moving away from Europe, with 55 % less confident in U.S. leadership. However, the Iraq‑War rift was principally military and legal, involving troop deployments of up to 150 000 U.S. forces and prompting the EU to launch its first Common Security and Defence Policy in December 2003. The current dispute is political‑strategic, centred on rhetoric and a security doctrine, with no direct troop movements but significant implications for NATO coordination, sanctions on Russia, and forthcoming trade negotiations.

The duration of the two rifts also diverges. The Iraq‑War tension peaked over a twelve‑month period before normalising through joint counter‑terrorism initiatives. By contrast, the “Trump assault” rift remains unresolved as of 15 December 2025, with no formal reconciliation mechanism activated and EU‑US dialogue postponed until late 2026. The split among EU members suggests a protracted debate over how to balance criticism of U.S. policy with the practicalities of transatlantic security cooperation.

In sum, the immediate market reaction – a record‑high Dow followed by a swift correction and a modest FTSE rise – reflects short‑term volatility, while the broader diplomatic schism threatens to reshape the transatlantic relationship for years to come. The EU’s unified condemnation of both the physical act and the strategic narrative signals a willingness to defend its sovereignty, yet the internal split among member states hints at a more fragmented European response than in previous crises.
