**Friedrich Merz’s bid to turn frozen Russian reserves into a €90‑105 bn loan for Kyiv collapsed at the EU summit in Brussels, forcing the bloc to revert to a market‑based €105 bn loan that leaves the €210 bn of immobilised assets untouched.** The German chancellor’s “sovereign‑asset‑backed loan” proposal – which would have used roughly €185 bn held in Euroclear as collateral – was blocked by Belgium and other sceptical members, prompting a shift in tone from the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen toward a legally safer joint‑borrowing solution.

The plan represented a stark departure from the EU’s original 2014 response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea, which relied on targeted sanctions against individuals and sectoral entities rather than any use of sovereign Russian reserves. In March 2014 the Council adopted Decision CFSP/2014/34, imposing travel bans and asset freezes on a short list of Russian elites; the sanctions were later expanded in July 2014 to finance, oil and defence sectors. Those measures affected only a few billion euros of personal wealth – for example a US $36 m property owned by Arkady Rotenberg – and never touched the state‑level reserves that now total around €210 bn.

Merz’s 2025 blueprint sought to mobilise that sovereign pool, proposing a “reparations loan” underpinned by the frozen assets. The idea was to issue a €90‑105 bn loan to Ukraine, with interest and returns from the assets servicing the debt. The proposal required unanimous approval because the assets are held in Belgium’s Euroclear clearing house, and Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever warned of “multi‑billion‑euro losses at court” and possible compensation claims from Russia. His legal‑risk concerns, echoed by Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Italy, proved decisive.

In the aftermath, the European Council’s 18‑19 December summit produced a €105 bn loan financed from capital markets, explicitly excluding any direct seizure of the frozen reserves. Von der Leyen’s summit communiqué stressed the need for a “legal and financially sound way” to use the assets, while Merz maintained that “if Russia does not pay reparations we will – in full accordance with international law – make use of Russian immobilised assets for paying back the loan.” The compromise left the assets immobilised, disappointing Kyiv’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who called the decision “one of the clearest and most morally justified” possibilities.

Moscow reacted with equal vehemence. On 12 December the Russian Central Bank, via Governor Elvira Nabiullina, announced a lawsuit against Euroclear seeking US $230 bn (≈ €210 bn) in damages, branding the EU’s plan “illegal and amounts to theft.” The following day, Russian ambassador to Belgium Denis Gonchar warned that “freezing the money is already illegal; using it for reparations is outright theft,” and cautioned of “serious trouble” for Belgium. These statements underscored the Kremlin’s readiness to pursue legal retaliation and highlighted the diplomatic stakes of any asset‑seizure move.

The episode illustrates how the EU’s toolbox has evolved from punitive sanctions to attempts at asset‑leveraging, yet also how political and legal constraints still curb bold financial engineering. While the 2014 sanctions were limited in scope but widely accepted, the 2025 proposal exposed deep fissures among member states over sovereignty, legal risk and the precedent of expropriating another nation’s central‑bank reserves. The bloc’s ultimate reliance on market borrowing signals a cautious return to familiar financing routes, leaving the frozen Russian assets in limbo and the question of their future use unresolved.
