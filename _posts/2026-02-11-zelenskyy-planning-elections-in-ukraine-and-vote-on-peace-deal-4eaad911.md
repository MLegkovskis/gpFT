### Zelenskyy to Announce Elections and Peace Referendum in Ukraine
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is planning to announce a presidential election and a peace referendum on February 24, 2026. The referendum will include a vote on a peace deal that involves territorial concessions, including the transfer of the Donbas region to Russia. The deal is expected to include security guarantees, reconstruction aid, and a freeze on further sanctions against Russia.

The vote is expected to take place in May 2026, before the May 15, 2026, U.S. deadline. The referendum will be held simultaneously with a presidential election, with special legislation allowing voting under martial law.

The peace deal is reported to contain territorial concessions, most notably the transfer of the Donbas region to Russia in exchange for security guarantees. U.S. assistance and broader Western security guarantees are conditioned on the conclusion of a peace deal that meets Washington’s deadline.
