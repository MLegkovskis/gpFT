**Cuba’s economy is teetering at a fragile 1 % growth target for 2026, a modest rebound that still sits far below the more than 9 % expansion the island might have achieved without the U.S. embargo, according to a 2025 UN delegation. The modest outlook reflects a decade of sanctions cycles – from the Obama‑era thaw that briefly lifted tourism and remittance flows, to the Trump administration’s re‑imposition of travel bans and financial restrictions that drove GDP down to –1.9 % in 2023.** 

The latest Cuban plan, announced on 18 December 2025, projects a 1 % rise in real GDP for 2026, matching Trading Economics’ model. Yet the figure masks a structural stagnation rooted in a blockade that has cost the island roughly $1 trillion over 55 years. The comprehensive embargo, in place since 1960, has choked export‑import volumes, limited foreign direct investment by about 30 % in the 1990s, and forced the economy into a “Special Period” contraction of 34 % between 1989 and 1992. Even when the Obama administration opened the door to tourism – raising visitor numbers from one million in 2013 to 2.7 million in 2017 – the gains were quickly erased by Trump’s 2017 travel ban and subsequent financial curbs that cut tourism revenue by $1.5 bn in 2020 and slashed remittances by 15 % the same year. 

Comparing the original 1960 embargo with today’s reality highlights how little has changed in its core mechanisms. The 1960 Executive Order 12170 banned virtually all trade, leaving the United States to account for roughly 90 % of Cuba’s foreign trade before the embargo; today U.S. exports to Cuba amount to a mere $45 million, about 0.2 % of total trade. Tourism, once a vibrant conduit for American visitors, fell from pre‑revolution levels of one million annually to under 10 000 after the embargo, and even the brief resurgence to 2.27 million in 2016 under Obama has receded to 1.48 million in 2023 – a 35 % drop attributable to Trump’s restrictions. Remittances, a vital lifeline, fell from $1.2 bn in 2016 to $840 m in 2019 after OFAC tightened money‑transfer services, a 30 % decline that directly dented GDP. 

The remaining levers for a future Trump‑era administration are therefore limited to tightening the existing framework: re‑imposing or expanding the travel ban, tightening the 2019 Cuban Assets Control Regulations that cap remittance channels, and extending the 2020 ban on dual‑use telecommunications equipment. Such moves would inflict short‑term pain – further reducing tourism revenue and cutting off the modest flow of technology – but historical evidence suggests they would not translate into political leverage. The embargo has never succeeded in toppling the Cuban regime; instead it has entrenched anti‑U.S. sentiment and eroded American soft power, as reflected in UN votes that have risen from roughly 80 % opposition in the 1970s to a record 94 % in 2022 calling for an end to the sanctions. 

Lessons from the past are stark. Economic pressure alone has failed to force democratic change, while humanitarian costs have damaged U.S. credibility. Partial easings, such as the limited food‑only licences of the Carter era or Biden’s 2025 expansion of humanitarian assistance, have produced only symbolic gains without altering the embargo’s fundamental structure. Consequently, any attempt by a future Trump administration to “topple” Cuba would likely involve further tightening rather than a decisive new strategy, delivering limited economic impact and further isolating the United States diplomatically. 

In short, the embargo’s core components remain intact, and the modest 1 % growth forecast for 2026 underscores how deeply the island’s economy is constrained by a policy that has persisted for more than six decades. Without a comprehensive repeal, the United States can at most fine‑tune the sanctions, a manoeuvre that history shows yields little more than short‑lived economic discomfort for Cuba while eroding U.S. standing on the world stage.
