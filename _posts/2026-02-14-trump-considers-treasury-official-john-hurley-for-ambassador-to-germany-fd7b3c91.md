### Trump Considers Treasury Official John Hurley for Ambassador to Germany
President Trump is considering Treasury Under-Secretary John Hurley for the position of US Ambassador to Germany. This potential appointment has significant implications for US-Germany diplomatic relations.

#### Background and Experience
John Hurley currently serves as the Under-Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) at the US Treasury. His experience in this role, as well as his previous service on the President's Intelligence Advisory Board (PIAB), could be beneficial in deepening US-German cooperation on security and financial issues.

#### Potential Policy Impact
The potential appointment of Hurley could have both positive and negative implications. On the one hand, his expertise in sanctions and financial-crime enforcement could accelerate joint US-German efforts to enforce Russian-related sanctions. On the other hand, his limited diplomatic experience and close ties to Trump may create friction with German officials, particularly on issues such as climate policy and trade.

#### German Reaction
The German government has expressed cautious optimism about the potential appointment, with Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stating that they welcome any ambassador who can deepen cooperation on security and economic issues. However, they also expect a partner who respects the multilateral climate agenda.

#### US State Department View
The US State Department has warned that a political appointee without prior diplomatic experience may need strong support from the embassy staff to avoid friction with German officials.

#### Conclusion
The potential appointment of John Hurley as US Ambassador to Germany has significant implications for US-Germany diplomatic relations. While his Treasury experience could be beneficial, his limited diplomatic track record and close ties to Trump may create challenges. The outcome of his potential appointment will depend on his ability to navigate these complexities and build strong relationships with German officials.
