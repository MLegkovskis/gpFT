**Shares in data‑centre REIT Fermi slumped by almost half after a prospective tenant withdrew a $150 million funding commitment for its Texas “Project Matador”, sending the newly listed group into a steep sell‑off and raising fresh doubts over its cash‑flow outlook.**  

## Immediate market reaction  

At the open on 12 December 2025 the London‑listed shares of Fermi Inc. (NASDAQ: FRMI) were down 46 per cent, trading around $9.00, a fall from the $15.38 close a week earlier. In New York the stock fell a further 31 per cent in pre‑market trading. The move marked the steepest single‑day decline for the company since its October IPO, when it debuted at a market capitalisation of roughly $14.8 billion despite having no revenue.  

## The aborted funding deal  

The setback stems from the termination of an agreement with an undisclosed, investment‑grade tenant that had agreed to lease part of the 1 GW‑scale Project Matador site in West Texas and to provide up to $150 million of upfront financing for construction. Under the original terms the tenant would have secured a long‑term lease for a portion of the data‑centre campus and, in return, supplied the capital needed to bring the first phase online. By Friday the tenant had formally pulled the funding, citing concerns over Fermi’s ability to meet its operational milestones and the broader volatility in AI‑driven data‑centre demand.  

## Operational and financial context  

Fermi, co‑founded by former U.S. energy secretary Rick Perry, positions itself as a vertically integrated provider of low‑carbon power and data‑centre capacity for artificial‑intelligence workloads. The firm remains pre‑revenue; its Q3 2025 results showed a net loss of $347 million on a cash burn of $210 million. The company’s balance sheet lists $1.2 billion of debt, with a forward price‑to‑earnings multiple of 79.9 (based on projected earnings from future leases).  

## Analyst commentary  

Equity analysts at Goldman Sachs and Barclays downgraded the stock to “underweight”, warning that the loss of the $150 million advance removes a critical bridge to the first revenue stream. “Fermi’s business model is heavily front‑loaded with capital expenditure. Without a cornerstone tenant, the risk of further financing gaps rises sharply,” said a senior analyst at Barclays.  

## Outlook and next steps  

Fermi’s management indicated that discussions with the tenant continue and that alternative financing sources are being explored, including a potential $200 million power‑supply agreement with Xcel Energy’s subsidiary Southwestern Public Service. However, the company must secure a new anchor lease or external capital within the next six months to avoid breaching covenants on its existing debt facilities.  

The episode underscores the fragility of early‑stage, AI‑focused infrastructure REITs, where a single tenant’s decision can swing market sentiment dramatically. Investors will be watching closely for any fresh commitments that could stabilise Fermi’s cash position and restore confidence in its long‑term growth narrative.
