**Shares in data‑centre property group Fermi have slumped almost 50 % after a key tenant withdrew a £250 million funding commitment, sending the London‑listed stock down to 78 pence from a pre‑announcement high of 150 pence and halving the company’s market capitalisation to roughly £310 million.**  

## Funding pull‑out and immediate market reaction  

The tenant – identified in filings as EdgeCloud, a pan‑European cloud services provider – announced on 10 December that it would not proceed with the £250 million equity injection it had pledged for Fermi’s planned Manchester data‑centre hub. EdgeCloud cited “significant concerns over Fermi’s current liquidity profile and the ability to meet agreed‑upon construction milestones”. The withdrawal triggered an automatic covenant breach on Fermi’s £420 million net‑debt facility, prompting its senior lenders to place the facility on watch and to demand immediate remedial action.  

Within hours of the disclosure, Fermi’s shares fell 48 % to 78 pence, wiping out roughly £310 million of market value. The FTSE 250 index, where Fermi is a constituent, recorded a 0.3 % dip on the news.  

## Financial position before the setback  

Prior to the funding pull‑out, Fermi reported a net‑debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.2 ×, well above the 3.0 × covenant ceiling. Its latest audited accounts (year ended 31 July 2025) showed revenue of £115 million, EBITDA of £100 million and a cash balance of £30 million. The company’s balance sheet already reflected a £150 million revolving credit line that was fully drawn, leaving limited headroom for additional borrowing.  

## Analyst downgrades and revised forecasts  

Barclays cut its price target from 120 pence to 70 pence, a 42 % reduction, while HSBC trimmed its target to 68 pence, citing “heightened refinancing risk and a likely slowdown in new lease pipelines”. S&P downgraded Fermi’s credit rating from BB to BB‑, noting the “material deterioration in liquidity and the loss of a strategic tenant”.  

## Management response and next steps  

Chief Financial Officer Laura Whitaker told investors on a conference call that the board is “actively exploring bridge‑finance options, including a potential rights issue and asset‑sale discussions”. She added that the company remains committed to completing the Manchester project, albeit with a revised timeline that pushes the expected operational date from Q3 2026 to Q1 2027.  

## Regulatory and sector context  

The UK Financial Conduct Authority has been notified of the covenant breach, though no formal investigation has been launched. The incident arrives amid a broader sector slowdown, with European data‑centre REITs collectively seeing a 12 % decline in occupancy rates over the past six months as cloud providers tighten capex.  

## Outlook  

Fermi’s ability to stabilise its balance sheet will hinge on securing short‑term liquidity and restoring tenant confidence. Until a definitive financing solution is announced, analysts expect the share price to remain volatile, with further downside risk if additional tenants reconsider their commitments.
