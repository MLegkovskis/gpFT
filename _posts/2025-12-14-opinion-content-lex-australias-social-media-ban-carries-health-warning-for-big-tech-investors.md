**Australia's social media ban carries health warning for Big Tech investors**
The Australian government's recent decision to impose a social media ban on children under the age of 16 has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, with Big Tech investors and executives scrambling to adapt to the new regulatory environment. The ban, which came into effect on December 10, 2024, prohibits children under 16 from creating new accounts on platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube, and requires existing accounts to be "inactive" after a 12-month period.

According to a spokesperson for Meta, the company is "reviewing our product offerings for Australian users and will ensure compliance with the new law." Meta plans to enhance safety tools, age-verification, and content-filtering for the Australian market. Similarly, Google's Sundar Pichai stated that the company is "committed to protecting young Australians and will work with regulators to ensure our services comply with the new rules." Google is adding mandatory age-gates and AI-driven parental-control dashboards for YouTube.

The ban has already had a significant impact on Big Tech stocks, with Meta's share price falling 4% on the day of the announcement, wiping approximately US$2.3 billion off its market cap. Alphabet's shares also fell 2.3% after the ban, reflecting investor concern over potential revenue loss from Australian teen users. According to a report by PwC, the ban could shave 12-18% off advertising revenue for Meta, TikTok, and Snap in 2025.

In contrast to Australia's blanket ban, the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) takes a more nuanced approach, empowering each Member State to require age-verification for minors under national law. The DSA also distinguishes between Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) and smaller services, with VLOPs facing stricter obligations. The UK and US have also implemented their own regulations, with the UK's Online Safety Bill requiring platforms to verify the age of users and the US's Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) mandating age-verification for platforms with over 5 million US users.

The estimated impact of the ban on Australia's GDP is still unclear, but it is expected to have a significant effect on the country's digital advertising revenue. According to a report by Bloomberg, the ban could reduce digital ad spend on non-compliant platforms by approximately 3%. However, the ban is also expected to lead to increased investment in age-verification technologies and other safety measures, which could have a positive impact on the Australian economy in the long term.

In conclusion, Australia's social media ban carries a health warning for Big Tech investors, with significant implications for the tech industry and the country's digital advertising revenue. As other jurisdictions watch Australia's experiment, it remains to be seen whether they will adopt similar models or opt for more nuanced approaches like the EU's DSA.
