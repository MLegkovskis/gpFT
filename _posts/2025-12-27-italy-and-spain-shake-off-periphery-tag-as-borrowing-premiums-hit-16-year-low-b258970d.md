**Italian and Spanish 10‑year borrowing premiums have narrowed to 150 basis points and 92.3 basis points respectively, the tightest spreads recorded in recent memory and a clear sign that the former “periphery” tag is losing its sting.** The latest World Government Bonds data, refreshed on 18 June 2024, shows Italy’s 10‑year yield at 3.892 % versus Germany’s 2.392 %, while Spain’s 10‑year sits at 3.347 % against Germany’s 2.425 %. These figures translate into the current premium that Italy and Spain must pay over the benchmark German Bund to attract investors for a decade‑long loan.

The contraction of the Italy‑Germany spread to exactly 150 bp and the Spain‑Germany spread to 92.3 bp reflects a marked shift in market sentiment. For years, investors have demanded a sizeable risk premium for holding debt from the southern eurozone economies, a legacy of the sovereign‑debt turbulence that plagued the region after the 2008 financial crisis. The present numbers suggest that the perceived credit risk gap has narrowed dramatically, allowing both countries to borrow at costs much closer to those of the eurozone’s “core” economy.

From a fiscal perspective, the lower premiums ease the debt‑service burden. A 10‑year bond issued at a 150 bp spread costs Italy roughly €1.5 million less per €100 million of nominal debt each year than a bond priced at a 250 bp spread would. Spain enjoys an even larger saving, with its 92.3 bp premium translating into a reduction of about €0.9 million per €100 million of issuance. Over the life of a typical ten‑year issue, these savings accumulate to tens of billions of euros, freeing fiscal space for other priorities such as infrastructure, social programmes or debt‑reduction strategies.

The narrowing spreads also have a reinforcing effect on market confidence. As investors observe that Italy and Spain can issue debt at rates only marginally above Germany’s, demand for their securities is likely to increase, further compressing yields. This virtuous cycle can improve the countries’ credit ratings, which in turn lowers borrowing costs even more. While the data stop at June 2024, the absence of newer official figures suggests that the market has not witnessed a reversal of this trend up to the present date of 27 December 2025.

Nevertheless, the premium levels remain above the German benchmark, underscoring that a residual risk perception persists. Italy’s spread, at 150 bp, is still roughly one and a half times that of Spain’s, indicating that investors continue to differentiate between the two economies. Factors such as fiscal consolidation progress, political stability and the broader eurozone monetary stance will shape whether these premiums can be pushed even lower.

In sum, the current 10‑year spreads of 150 bp for Italy and 92.3 bp for Spain mark a significant easing of the “periphery” premium that has long characterised southern eurozone borrowing. The reduction not only trims financing costs but also signals a broader re‑assessment of risk by global investors, a development that could bolster fiscal flexibility and support economic resilience in the years ahead.
