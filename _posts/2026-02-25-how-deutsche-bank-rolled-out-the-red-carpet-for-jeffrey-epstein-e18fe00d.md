# Deutsche Bank's Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein
Deutsche Bank's association with Jeffrey Epstein has had significant implications for the bank's reputation, stock price, and the global financial system. The relationship, which began in August 2013, lasted for five years despite Epstein's criminal history and ongoing civil allegations.
## Compliance Issues and Regulatory Penalties
The bank's compliance staff raised concerns about Epstein's accounts, but senior relationship managers overrode them, citing the profitability of his business. This led to a $150 million fine from the NYDFS in 2020 for anti-money-laundering (AML) failures tied to Epstein.
## Market Reaction and Broader Implications
The revelations triggered a wave of negative media coverage and shareholder criticism, with Deutsche Bank's stock price falling sharply after the NYDFS fine and subsequent media coverage. The episode also exposed systemic AML weaknesses, triggered regulatory reforms, and produced measurable market turbulence.
## Regulatory Reforms and Industry-Wide Impact
The fallout has spurred the U.S. Treasury and the Financial Stability Board to issue new guidance on 'high-risk correspondent banking' and to tighten AML expectations for banks handling politically exposed persons (PEPs). Banks have collectively raised AML/CTF budgets by approximately 15% in 2021-22, citing the Epstein-Deutsche Bank episode as a catalyst for senior-management attention.
