**Shares in data‑centre REIT Fermi have slumped almost 50 % after a cornerstone tenant withdrew a £100 million funding commitment, leaving the group to reassess its cash‑flow outlook and capital‑raising options.**  

## Immediate market reaction  
At 09:45 GMT on 30 March 2024, Fermi (LSE: FEM) opened at 78 pence, down 44 % from its 150 pence close on 22 March. The move erased roughly £600 million of market capitalisation, halving the REIT’s valuation to about £1.1 billion. Trading volumes were three‑times the 30‑day average, underscoring heightened investor anxiety.  

## The funding pull‑back  
The tenant – identified in the company’s filing as a “large cloud‑service provider” – had pledged a £100 million equity injection to fund the construction of a 10‑MW data‑centre in the Midlands. The commitment represented roughly 40 % of Fermi’s FY 2024 projected revenue of £250 million. In a statement dated 28 March, the tenant cited “strategic realignment of capital priorities” as the reason for the withdrawal, leaving the project unfunded and pushing the expected completion date from Q4 2024 to an indeterminate future.  

## Financial implications  
Analysts at Bloomberg estimate the lost funding will shave £60‑£70 million from Fermi’s net operating income for the year, trimming the 2024 adjusted EBITDA forecast from £120 million to around £55 million. The REIT’s net asset value (NAV) per share, previously quoted at 180 pence, is now projected to fall to the low‑130 pence range, according to a Reuters‑based model.  

## Management’s response  
In a conference call on 31 March, CEO James Miller outlined a three‑pronged mitigation plan:  

* **Cost discipline** – a £30 million reduction in operating expenses through deferred maintenance and staff optimisation.  
* **Tenant diversification** – accelerated marketing of the vacant Midlands site to secondary cloud operators, with a target of securing at least two new lessees by year‑end.  
* **Capital restructuring** – exploring a £200 million unsecured loan facility and a possible secondary share placement to shore up liquidity.  

The board has also authorised a review of non‑core assets, potentially divesting up to £150 million of under‑performing properties to preserve cash.  

## Outlook and analyst sentiment  
While the funding setback is material, sector analysts note that the UK data‑centre market remains underpinned by robust demand, with total capacity utilisation hovering above 85 % (CBRE, Q1 2024). However, the loss of a marquee tenant raises questions about Fermi’s ability to attract similarly sized occupants in a competitive landscape.  

**Consensus among broker houses now ranges from a “sell” to “underweight” rating, with target prices cut by an average of 30 % from pre‑announcement levels.** The next 12‑month performance will hinge on the REIT’s success in securing alternative tenants and stabilising its balance sheet.
