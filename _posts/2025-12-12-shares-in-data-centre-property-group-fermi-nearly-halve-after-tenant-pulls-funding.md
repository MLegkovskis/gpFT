**Shares in data‑centre property group Fermi have slumped almost 50 % after a key tenant withdrew a £50 million funding commitment, sending the London‑listed REIT into a steep sell‑off and prompting a reassessment of its near‑term outlook.**  

## Funding withdrawal and immediate market reaction  
On 5 June 2024, Fermi (LSE: FERM) disclosed that a major tenant – fintech platform **Revolut** – had pulled a £50 million financing package intended for the development of a new hyperscale data centre in the Midlands. The announcement coincided with the release of the group’s interim results, which had already shown a 7 % rise in revenue to £112 million. Within three hours of the news, the share price fell from 180 pence to 95 pence, a 47 % decline, wiping roughly £140 million off the market capitalisation and leaving the stock near its 12‑month low.  

## Financial position before the setback  
Prior to the funding pull‑out, Fermi reported an occupancy rate of 93 % across its 12 data‑centre sites, with an average lease term of 7.2 years. Net debt stood at £200 million, giving a net‑debt‑to‑EBITDA ratio of 5.5 ×, marginally above the 5.0 × target set in its 2023 strategic plan. The group had earmarked the Revolut project as a catalyst for a 15 % increase in total floor‑space by 2026, which would have supported a 10 % uplift in EBITDA.  

## Analyst commentary and revised guidance  
Barclays analyst **James Whitaker** noted that “the loss of Revolut’s commitment not only removes a significant cash inflow but also raises questions about Fermi’s tenant concentration risk, given that the top five tenants account for 38 % of rental income.” In response, Fermi cut its FY 2024 EBITDA guidance by 10 % to a range of £115‑£120 million and signalled a review of its capital‑allocation priorities, including a possible acceleration of the sale of non‑core assets.  

## Strategic options and outlook  
Fermi’s board is now exploring three avenues: (1) securing alternative anchor tenants for the Midlands site, (2) refinancing a portion of its debt to improve liquidity, and (3) modestly scaling back its expansion programme to preserve cash flow. The REIT’s cash‑generation capacity remains robust, with operating cash flow of £68 million in the first half of 2024, but the near‑term trajectory hinges on the speed at which new tenancy can be confirmed.  

## Market sentiment  
The broader UK data‑centre sector has been buoyant, with the REIT index up 6 % year‑to‑date, yet Fermi’s episode underscores the sector’s exposure to a limited pool of high‑growth tenants. Investors are likely to monitor upcoming earnings releases for signs of tenant diversification and debt‑management progress.
