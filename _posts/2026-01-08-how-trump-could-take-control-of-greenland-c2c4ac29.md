**Donald Trump’s renewed call to acquire Greenland has reignited a debate that echoes the United States’ 1867 purchase of Alaska, yet the two propositions could not be more disparate in price, legal complexity and geopolitical climate.** While the Alaska deal was sealed for a modest $7.2 million and later celebrated as a masterstroke, the modern notion of buying the world’s largest island—an autonomous Danish territory of 811,000 sq mi—faces multi‑billion‑dollar price tags, a web of international approvals and staunch opposition from Denmark, Greenlandic leaders and European allies.

The Alaska Purchase, negotiated by Secretary of State William H. Seward with the Russian Empire, transferred 586,412 sq mi for roughly two cents per acre. The treaty was signed on 30 March 1867, ratified by the Senate and enacted by President Johnson within weeks. Critics derided it as “Seward’s Folly,” but the acquisition eventually supplied oil, gas and minerals that underpinned American growth. By contrast, Trump’s 4 March 2025 address to Congress, in which he vowed to obtain Greenland “one way or the other,” has produced no treaty, no price and no diplomatic overture from Denmark. Analysts speculate that Greenland’s rare‑earth deposits, uranium and zinc could command a multi‑billion‑dollar sum, but the figure remains speculative.

Procedurally, the two deals diverge sharply. The Alaska transaction required a single treaty and a two‑thirds Senate majority—an ordinary constitutional exercise. Acquiring Greenland would demand not only a comparable Senate super‑majority and appropriations bill, but also the consent of Denmark, the autonomous Greenlandic government, the European Union and possibly a United Nations process. The Danish Constitution does not permit the sale of an autonomous region, and Denmark has repeatedly declared the island “not for sale.” The EU’s involvement adds another layer of scrutiny, as any transfer of territory within its jurisdiction would need its sign‑off.

Strategic rationales echo across the centuries. In the 19th century, Alaska offered a foothold on the Pacific, potential fur and gold, and a counter‑balance to British expansion. Today, Greenland is prized for its Arctic gateway, the Thule Air Base, and a cache of critical minerals essential to high‑tech industries. Trump’s narrative frames the island as a national security asset, arguing that control of the Arctic would cement U.S. dominance in a region increasingly contested by Russia and China.

Public and diplomatic reactions, however, are worlds apart. The Alaska Purchase survived initial ridicule to become a celebrated component of American expansion. Greenland’s prospect, meanwhile, has been met with immediate rebuke. Danish officials and Greenlandic leaders have labelled the idea “unrealistic” and a breach of sovereignty, while European allies have rallied behind Denmark’s stance. Media outlets such as the BBC and Reuters underscore the diplomatic flashpoint, noting that any U.S. move would strain trans‑Atlantic relations.

The financial implications further diminish Greenland’s appeal. Even if the United States were to allocate the necessary funds, the cost would dwarf the $150 million equivalent of the Alaska price in today’s dollars. Congressional appropriations would be scrutinised amid competing budgetary pressures, and the political capital required to secure a two‑thirds Senate vote on a contentious foreign acquisition would be immense.

In sum, the comparison highlights a stark contrast between a historic, low‑cost purchase that expanded America’s frontier and a contemporary, high‑cost proposition that collides with modern legal frameworks and international norms. While both initiatives aim to secure a northern gateway, the Alaska Purchase succeeded because it involved a willing seller, a modest price and clear strategic benefits. Trump’s Greenland ambition, by contrast, confronts prohibitive costs, layered sovereignty issues and unified diplomatic resistance, rendering it a far more tenuous and unlikely venture.
