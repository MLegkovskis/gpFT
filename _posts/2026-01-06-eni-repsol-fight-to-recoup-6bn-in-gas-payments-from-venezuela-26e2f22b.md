**Eni and Repsol have taken legal action to recover roughly US $6 billion in unpaid gas payments from Venezuela, a sum that equates to just under six per cent of the country’s projected 2026 gross domestic product.** 

The two European oil majors filed lawsuits in mid‑2025 after Venezuela failed to meet its contractual obligations for gas supplied to the state‑run energy sector. The claim, disclosed on 15 June 2025, cites an outstanding balance of about US $6 billion. By contrast, Statista’s 2026 estimate places Venezuela’s nominal GDP at US $101.02 billion, meaning the debt represents approximately 5.9 % of the nation’s total economic output.

The magnitude of the arrears is striking in a country already grappling with severe fiscal pressures. A liability of this size, when measured against national output, underscores the strain on Venezuela’s public finances and its capacity to honour external commitments. For Eni, Italy’s largest integrated energy group, and Repsol, Spain’s leading oil and gas company, the unpaid amount is not merely a balance‑sheet line item; it is a material claim that could influence future investment decisions and the structuring of bilateral energy agreements.

From a legal perspective, the lawsuits signal a willingness by multinational firms to pursue arbitration and court remedies when state‑to‑state settlements break down. The cases also highlight the broader risk environment for foreign investors operating in jurisdictions where political and economic volatility can jeopardise contract performance. While the proceedings are still pending, the filing itself serves as a warning that creditors will seek enforceable recourse rather than accept indefinite deferment.

For Venezuela, the debt’s proportion of GDP raises questions about the sustainability of its energy‑related fiscal policies. The country’s reliance on hydrocarbon revenues has long been a double‑edged sword, providing essential foreign exchange while exposing the economy to price swings and payment defaults. A shortfall amounting to nearly one‑tenth of a tenth of annual output could constrain the government’s ability to fund public services, service external debt, or invest in diversification initiatives.

Analysts monitoring the situation are likely to assess the outcome of the lawsuits as a barometer of Venezuela’s willingness to honour commercial contracts and of the enforceability of international arbitration mechanisms in the region. Should the courts rule in favour of Eni and Repsol, the precedent could embolden other creditors to pursue similar actions, potentially reshaping the landscape of foreign investment in Venezuela’s energy sector.

In the meantime, the $6 billion claim remains a focal point in the ongoing dialogue between European energy firms and the Venezuelan state. It encapsulates the broader challenges of doing business in an economy where political risk and fiscal instability intersect, and it underscores the importance of robust contractual safeguards for multinational enterprises operating in high‑risk markets.
