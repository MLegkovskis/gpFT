### Tesla's Strategic Pivot to AI
Tesla's annual revenue has fallen for the first time, dropping 15% to $81.5 billion in 2023. In response, the company is shifting its focus towards AI, with a significant investment of $20 billion in AI-related projects in FY 2024. This pivot includes the development of AI-powered products such as Grok, a large-language model that will enable natural-language interaction in Tesla vehicles, and FSD v14.3, which will add expanded reasoning capabilities to the company's Full-Self-Driving technology.

### Planned AI-Powered Products
The company has announced several AI-powered products, including the Robotaxi, a steering-wheel-free, two-seat autonomous taxi, and the Optimus humanoid robot, which is expected to be produced in large quantities for both industrial and consumer markets. The Fremont plant will be repurposed for Optimus production and AI-centric battery/solar modules, with $5 billion allocated for re-tooling in FY 2024.

### Financial Shift
The shift towards AI is a significant change in Tesla's strategy, replacing a portion of its traditional car-selling focus. The company's mission has been updated to 'amazing abundance,' with AI-enabled products expected to generate 'universal high income.' While the financial implications of this shift are still uncertain, the company's investment in AI is a clear indication of its commitment to this new direction.
