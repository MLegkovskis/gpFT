**Milei’s hard‑line shock‑therapy aims to reverse Argentina’s exodus of multinationals, betting that fiscal austerity, monetary tightening and a suite of targeted incentives will finally restore investor confidence.** The president’s three‑phase programme, launched in December 2023, promises a swift cut in public spending, a freeze of base‑money growth and, by April 2025, full currency convertibility – a stark departure from the managed‑exchange, protectionist playbooks of the Kirchner and Macri eras.

The first phase, rolled out in December 2023, slashed the state’s footprint by reducing ministries from 22 to 12 and trimming the 2023 budget by roughly 15 %. A primary‑budget balance of plus one percent of GDP is targeted for 2025, while the corporate‑tax rate for multinationals is set to fall from 30 % to around 20 %. The fiscal discipline is matched by a “monetary shock” in June 2024: the central bank will freeze base‑money growth and impose a 2 % monthly crawling‑peg, aiming to bring inflation – still hovering near 250 % – down to below 30 % by 2025.

Exchange‑rate policy is equally radical. After a gradual transition from the crawling‑peg, Milei plans full convertibility – effectively dollarisation – after April 2025, accompanied by the removal of all capital controls. This contrasts sharply with the Kirchner administration’s fixed or heavily managed peso and the Macri government’s “cupo” ceiling that limited corporate repatriation.

Privatisation and public‑private partnership (PPP) initiatives form the backbone of the investment drive. At least five large state firms, including YPF, Aerolíneas Argentinas and Ferrocarriles, will be privatised immediately, while a US$5 bn PPP fund will finance infrastructure projects designed for multinational users. Regulatory reforms complement the structural changes: a new Intellectual‑Property law shortens patent‑grant time from 24 months to 12 months, and a “one‑stop‑shop” licensing regime reduces corporate‑registration time from 30 days to five.

The incentive package is tailored to lure foreign capital. Multinationals investing US$100 m or more receive a three‑year corporate‑tax holiday and a 30 % tax credit on capital‑equipment imports. A “re‑export zone” offers a 0 % VAT rate, further sweetening the proposition. Milei repeatedly declares, “We will make Argentina the most attractive place in the world for multinationals,” a message that seeks to overwrite the previous narrative of “sovereignty economics” that favoured domestic protection.

Analysts note that earlier governments relied on price controls, modest privatisations and ad‑hoc export‑tax rebates, keeping the state deeply embedded in the economy. By contrast, Milei’s coordinated shock‑therapy couples hard fiscal austerity with aggressive monetary tightening and a comprehensive reform agenda aimed squarely at re‑integrating Argentina into global value chains.

Early signs suggest the strategy is gaining traction. The U.S. State Department’s 2024 Investment‑Climate Report highlights the administration’s privatisation and ministry‑reduction plans as confidence‑building measures. GIS Reports from June 2024 underline the importance of the 2 % crawling peg and monetary freeze for restoring investor trust. An October 2025 analysis by Vizionapi observes that “the combination of fiscal discipline, monetary orthodoxy, and structural reforms has generated remarkable results: hyperinflation tamed, fiscal accounts balanced, external stability restored, and international confidence rebuilt.”

Whether these reforms will translate into a sustained return of multinationals remains to be seen, but Milei’s battle to reverse Argentina’s capital flight is now being fought on a markedly different battlefield – one defined by austerity, liberalisation and a clear, if aggressive, invitation to the global corporate community.
