# OpenAI’s ChatGPT Push Triggers Senior Staff Exits
The recent departures of several senior staff members at OpenAI, including Greg Brockman and Peter Deng, have raised concerns about the company's ability to maintain momentum and achieve its mission of building safe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
## Strategic and Roadmap Uncertainty
The loss of key leaders has reduced the core product-strategy team by approximately 30%, which may lead to decision latency for new ChatGPT capabilities and potentially push planned releases into later quarters.
## Safety and Alignment De-prioritization
The simultaneous loss of senior alignment leaders, including Ilya Sutskever and John Schulman, removes the majority of OpenAI's senior alignment leadership, which could lead to faster model scaling with fewer pre-deployment safety checks.
## Talent Migration to Competitors
The departure of key staff members to competitors, such as Anthropic, strengthens rival pipelines and may lead to a brain drain at OpenAI.
## Investor and Public Confidence
The exodus of senior staff coincides with heightened regulatory scrutiny, which may impact investor sentiment and public confidence in OpenAI's ability to deliver on its mission.
