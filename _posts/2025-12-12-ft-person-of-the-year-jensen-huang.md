**Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s charismatic chief executive, has been crowned Financial Times Person of the Year, a nod to his decisive role in turning artificial‑intelligence hardware into a trillion‑dollar market and reshaping the global tech landscape.**

## The Nvidia surge

- **Market value:** As of 11 December 2025, Nvidia’s market capitalisation sits just above **US$1.1 trillion**, a milestone reached after a 70 % share‑price rally this year.  
- **Revenue growth:** FY 2025 revenue is forecast at **US$45 billion**, up from **US$33 billion** in FY 2024, driven largely by data‑centre sales.  
- **Product leadership:** The company’s **H100 Tensor Core GPU** and the newer **GH200 Grace‑Hopper superchip** dominate AI training and inference workloads, cementing Nvidia’s position as the de‑facto supplier for large‑scale models such as GPT‑4‑Turbo and Gemini‑1.5.

## Huang’s AI vision

Huang has repeatedly argued that “AI is the new electricity”. Since taking the helm in 1993, he has:

1. **Pivoted from gaming to AI** – a strategic shift announced at the 2020 GTC conference that redirected R&D spend toward data‑centre GPUs.  
2. **Built an ecosystem** – the Nvidia AI Enterprise software suite and the Omniverse collaboration platform lock customers into a proprietary stack, boosting recurring revenue.  
3. **Championed open‑source** – by open‑sourcing CUDA‑based libraries (e.g., cuDNN, TensorRT), he has ensured that the broader AI community builds on Nvidia’s silicon.

## Economic ripple effects

- **Industry adoption:** Over **70 %** of the world’s top‑100 AI‑trained models now run on Nvidia hardware, according to a **Stanford AI Index 2025** report.  
- **Supply‑chain impact:** Nvidia’s demand for advanced silicon has accelerated the rollout of **TSMC’s 3‑nm process**, influencing global chip‑fab capacity planning.  
- **Policy relevance:** The U.S. Department of Commerce’s recent “AI Export Controls” list cites Nvidia as a critical technology provider, underscoring its geopolitical significance.

## Headwinds

- **Regulatory scrutiny:** Ongoing investigations in the EU over alleged anti‑competitive licensing of CUDA could reshape the software side of the business.  
- **Competitive pressure:** AMD’s MI300X and Intel’s Xe‑HPC chips are narrowing the performance gap, prompting Nvidia to double‑down on next‑gen architectures slated for 2026.  
- **Supply constraints:** Global wafer shortages and geopolitical tensions around Taiwan remain a risk to sustained growth.

## Conclusion

Jensen Huang’s elevation to FT Person of the Year recognises not just a personal triumph but a broader transformation: the mainstreaming of AI hardware that is redefining everything from cloud services to scientific research. His blend of technical foresight, ecosystem building, and market‑making has placed Nvidia at the heart of the AI revolution, and his leadership will likely steer the sector for years to come.
