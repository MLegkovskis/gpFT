**Tether’s €1.1 bn all‑cash offer would have been the first non‑family, crypto‑driven takeover in Juventus’ 124‑year history, but the Agnelli‑controlled Exor group has rebuffed the bid, keeping the club under the same stewardship that has defined it for a century.**  

The proposal, lodged on 12 December 2025, sought to buy Exor’s 65.4 % stake for €1.1 bn – a €2.66 per‑share price that sits roughly 30 % above Juventus’ closing market level of €2.04 on 11 December 2025, valuing the club at about €1.7 bn【<https://tether.io/news/tether-submits-proposal-to-acquire-juventus-football-club/】.> Tether already owns 11.53 % of the share capital and a board seat, meaning the deal would have taken its holding to a controlling level【<https://zycrypto.com/stablecoin-giant-tether-makes-bid-to-buy-popular-italian-soccer-powerhouse-juventus/】.>

**Historical context** – Since the Agnelli family bought a majority of shares in 1923, Juventus has been run by the Fiat/Exor lineage for 102 years, with ownership changes limited to internal succession or private negotiations. The Tether bid is the first external attempt by a financial‑technology firm with no football pedigree, marking a clear break from the club’s traditional model【<https://tether.io/news/tether-submits-proposal-to-acquire-juventus-football-club/】.>

**Regulatory and sporting implications** – Because Tether is a stable‑coin issuer, the transaction would have required clearance from Italian financial regulators (CONSOB) and compliance with EU anti‑money‑laundering rules, as well as UEFA’s Financial Fair Play (FFP) framework【<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-13/tether-s-1-1-billion-juventus-play-pits-new-money-against-old】.> Critics, including fan groups, warned of potential money‑laundering risks and a dilution of the club’s identity【<https://cryptobriefing.com/tether-takeover-bid-juventus/】.>

**Potential impact on management and operations** – If successful, the infusion of roughly $1 bn of “stable‑coin‑backed” cash could have funded player acquisitions, stadium upgrades and debt reduction. Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino pledged “stable capital and a long horizon” to support Juventus’ development【<https://zycrypto.com/stablecoin-giant-tether-makes-bid-to-buy-popular-italian-soccer-powerhouse-juventus/】.> The club would likely have seen new commercial avenues, such as crypto‑sponsorships, fan tokens, NFTs and the acceptance of USDT for tickets and merchandise, aligning with Tether’s broader strategy to “bridge digital and traditional finance”【<https://www.ainvest.com/news/tether-strategic-1-1b-juventus-bid-era-crypto-backed-sports-ownership-2512/】.> However, such a shift would also have imposed stricter AML/KYC procedures and heightened scrutiny from UEFA, potentially raising compliance costs.

**Owner reaction** – Exor’s chairman John Elkann reiterated the family’s commitment to Juventus, stating there was “no intention of selling any of its shares … to a third party, including … Tether”【<https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/47294176/juventus-owners-agnelli-family-takeover-cryptocurrency-tether】.> The public rejection underscores the cultural and strategic weight the Agnelli lineage still carries in Italian football.

**Bottom line** – Tether’s €1.1 bn bid was financially generous, technologically novel and culturally disruptive, but it collided with entrenched ownership, regulatory hurdles and fan sentiment. The failure of the offer leaves Juventus under the same Agnelli‑Exor control, preserving a century‑old governance model while the broader debate about crypto’s role in elite sport continues.
