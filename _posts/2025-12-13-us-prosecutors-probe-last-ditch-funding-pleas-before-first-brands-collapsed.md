**US prosecutors probe last-ditch funding pleas before First Brands collapsed**
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched a criminal inquiry into the collapse of First Brands, probing whether the company's leadership misled lenders about its financial health in a desperate bid to secure funding. According to a DOJ statement, "We are examining whether the company's leadership knowingly misled lenders about the quality of earnings and the extent of off-balance-sheet financing in a desperate attempt to secure additional funding." This development is part of a broader response from regulators, investors, and the judiciary to the company's downfall.

Key stakeholders, including the U.S. Trustee and creditor groups like Raistone Capital, have called for an independent examiner to investigate the company's financial dealings, citing "serious allegations of fraud, dishonesty, incompetence, misconduct, or mismanagement." The U.S. Trustee has filed a motion to accelerate the appointment of a bankruptcy examiner, while Raistone has pledged to fund part of the examiner's budget. First Brands' new management, advised by Alvarez & Marsal, has also sued the company's founder, Patrick James, alleging a "multibillion-dollar scheme" that left the company insolvent with over $10 billion in debt.

The company's collapse has significant implications for the broader history of corporate failures in the US, particularly in the auto-parts sector. First Brands' debt obligations of $10-$12 billion, with a large share hidden in CLOs and supply-chain financing, have drawn comparisons to earlier sector failures like Delphi and General Motors. However, the scale and structure of First Brands' debt, combined with the DOJ's focus on potential fraud in last-ditch funding pleas, set this case apart. As noted by industry analysts, First Brands is a "black box" with complex off-balance-sheet financing arrangements that have created a creditor battle with potential implications for factoring-industry regulation.

The collapse has already had significant market fallout, with at least 15 Business Development Companies (BDCs) disclosing exposure and share prices dropping sharply. The episode has reignited debate over regulatory oversight of CLOs and supply-chain financing, with calls for tighter SEC oversight and potential reforms to the private-credit market. As the situation continues to unfold, all parties are converging on the need for an examiner to untangle the complex web of off-balance-sheet deals that led to the $2.3 billion "vanishing" of funds.
