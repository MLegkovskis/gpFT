**US prosecutors are probing First Brands Group’s desperate funding pleas made in the weeks before the Ohio‑based auto‑parts supplier collapsed into Chapter 11, focusing on alleged fraud, double‑pledged collateral and the disappearance of $2.3 billion of off‑balance‑sheet financing.**  

## Collapse and Immediate Fallout  

First Brands filed for Chapter 11 protection in September 2025 after cash‑flow forecasts showed a deficit of $128 million in October, versus $31.5 million of operating cash generated. Court papers projected only $20.9 million would remain by the end of January, far short of the roughly $50 million per month required to keep production lines running. The company secured a $600 million debtor‑in‑possession (DIP) loan in November to stave off an immediate shutdown, but the loan’s pricing fell from par to 68/70 within weeks, reflecting heightened creditor risk.  

## DOJ Inquiry and Criminal Allegations  

The US Department of Justice opened a criminal investigation in October, sending formal inquiries to First Brands and its senior officers. Prosecutors are examining whether the firm’s last‑minute pleas for emergency financing involved false representations to lenders, including the alleged double‑pledging of the same receivables to multiple factoring firms.  

## Founder Accused of Multibillion‑Dollar Misappropriation  

New management, backed by restructuring adviser Alvarez & Marsal, filed a lawsuit on 4 November accusing founder Patrick James of “grievous misconduct”. The complaint alleges James diverted between $700 million and $1 billion into personal accounts and entities such as Battery Park Holdings, while also authorising the sale of fabricated invoices to obtain cash from factoring companies. The suit claims the scheme left First Brands with over $10 billion of debt and a missing $2.3 billion in off‑balance‑sheet financing. James’s legal team denies the allegations, calling the evidence “unsupported”.  

## Push for an Independent Examiner  

Raistone Capital, a short‑term financing provider that had extended $500 million to First Brands, petitioned the bankruptcy court for an independent examiner to trace the vanished $2.3 billion. The US Trustee’s office joined the request, arguing that “serious allegations of fraud, dishonesty, incompetence, misconduct or mismanagement” justify an accelerated appointment.  

## Impact on Creditors and the Market  

The probe has triggered a scramble among secured lenders, factoring investors and distressed‑fund managers to protect their claims. Approximately $150 million of receivables remain disputed, while Alvarez & Marsal estimates $101.6 million in cash has been recovered outside any factoring arrangement. The uncertainty has depressed the price of First Brands’ DIP notes and raised concerns about potential double‑payment of invoices, prompting the court to consider a framework that would segregate customer payments from contested accounts.  

## Outlook  

If the examiner uncovers extensive fraud, the bankruptcy estate could face additional civil penalties and possible restitution to defrauded creditors. Conversely, a clean bill of health would allow First Brands to focus on restructuring its $5 billion revenue business and stabilise operations with the newly approved $600 million financing. The DOJ’s findings, expected later this year, will be pivotal in determining the ultimate resolution of one of the most complex corporate collapses in recent US history.
