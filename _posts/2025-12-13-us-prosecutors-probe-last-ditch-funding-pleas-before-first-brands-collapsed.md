**US prosecutors are probing whether First Brands Group’s senior executives misrepresented the company’s financial condition in a series of last‑ditch funding pleas made in the weeks before it filed for Chapter 11 protection on 28 September 2025.** The inquiry, which began in early December 2025, focuses on statements made to prospective lenders and private‑equity investors that the business was “on a clear path to recovery” despite a balance‑sheet showing more than $11 billion of liabilities and cash of less than $15 million at the time of filing.

## Collapse of an over‑leveraged parts supplier  

First Brands, a global aftermarket automotive parts distributor, announced its Chapter 11 petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas on 28 September 2025. The filing listed:

* Total liabilities: **$11.2 billion** (including $5.5 billion in term loans, $226 million in asset‑based credit, and $2.3 billion in off‑balance‑sheet inventory and lease facilities).  
* Annual revenue: **≈ $5 billion**.  
* Cash on hand at filing: **$14.8 million**.  

The company secured a **$1.1 billion debtor‑in‑possession (DIP) facility** from an ad‑hoc group of lenders, of which $500 million was injected immediately to fund operations during restructuring.

## Prosecutorial focus on funding pleas  

According to people familiar with the investigation, prosecutors are examining a series of investor presentations and confidential memoranda circulated between July and early September 2025. Those documents purported to show:

* Projected cash‑flow breakeven by Q1 2026, despite the imminent maturity of $900 million of debt in the next twelve months.  
* “Substantial liquidity” backed by undisclosed supply‑chain financing arrangements, later revealed to be **$250 million** of factoring that had been frozen by the bankruptcy court.  

If the statements were knowingly false, they could constitute wire fraud and securities violations under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343 and 1001.

## Lawsuit against former chief executive  

In parallel, First Brands filed a civil suit on 3 November 2025 against its founder and former CEO, **Patrick James**, alleging that he “fraudulently secured billions of dollars of financing” by overstating assets and diverting “hundreds of millions of dollars” to entities under his control. The complaint cites internal emails indicating James authorised the use of company cash to fund personal trusts, leaving the firm with **$12 million** in cash at the time of the bankruptcy filing.

## Implications for creditors and the restructuring plan  

The criminal probe adds uncertainty to the ongoing restructuring. The DIP lenders, who hold the senior $1.1 billion loan, have already seen market prices fall to **63 cents on the dollar** as of 10 December 2025, reflecting fears of further undisclosed liabilities. Should the investigation result in charges, executives could face fines, restitution, and imprisonment, and any recovered assets may be distributed to unsecured creditors, who currently hold claims totalling **$4.3 billion**.

First Brands’ restructuring plan, filed on 15 December 2025, proposes a **70 % haircut** to unsecured creditors in exchange for equity in a re‑emerged entity. The plan’s approval hinges on the court’s assessment of the criminal investigation’s findings and the ability of the DIP facility to fund operations through the projected 2026 turnaround.

The case underscores the heightened scrutiny of corporate fundraising practices in distressed sectors and signals that U.S. authorities will pursue aggressive action where investor deception is suspected.
