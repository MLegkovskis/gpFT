**Trump’s 2026 pledge to tap Venezuela’s oil could add up to $15 billion a year to the country’s economy, a boost that would lift GDP by roughly a tenth and raise oil’s share of output to nearly half, analysts say.** The former president’s claim – made at a Florida rally on 2 January – revives a long‑standing U.S. focus on Venezuela’s vast hydrocarbon endowment and signals a possible shift from sanction‑based pressure to a more aggressive extraction agenda, should Washington ease its restrictions on oil‑service equipment.

Venezuela’s proven reserves sit at an estimated 303 billion barrels, about 17 % of the world’s total, according to the latest OPEC and U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Valued at the 2024 average crude price of $80 a barrel, the resource is worth roughly $24 trillion, with a plausible range of $20‑$30 trillion depending on price fluctuations. Trump’s “tremendous” comment rests on the premise that U.S. firms could double or triple current Venezuelan output – from roughly one million barrels per day to two‑to‑three million – by investing in heavy‑crude upgrading plants and securing at least partial relief from sanctions.

If such a production increase materialises, annual oil revenue would climb by $10‑$15 billion (2‑3 million bpd × $80 × 365 days). With Venezuela’s 2023 GDP recorded at $110.5 billion, the infusion would represent a 9‑14 % uplift. Oil’s contribution to GDP, already about 30 % in 2022, could rise to 40‑45 %, while government royalties from the sector might double from $5‑$6 billion to $12‑$18 billion. In a hyper‑inflationary environment where price growth has exceeded 1 000 % year‑on‑year, the additional fiscal firepower could modestly stabilise the economy, though the ultimate impact will hinge on the Maduro government’s capacity to channel revenues into macro‑economic reforms.

The proposal fits a historical pattern of U.S. policy that has long treated Venezuelan oil as a strategic lever. From the 1920s, when the United States imported roughly 70 % of Venezuelan crude, through the Bush administration’s 2006 weapons ban and Obama’s 2014 sanctions that sought to choke the regime’s lifeline, successive governments have alternated between engagement and punitive measures. The Trump administration of 2017‑2021 intensified pressure with “Caesar” sanctions on PDVSA and secondary sanctions on entities dealing in Venezuelan oil, cutting the state oil company’s cash flow by about $5 billion annually.

What distinguishes the 2026 pronouncement is its explicit claim of “extracting” oil rather than merely “blocking” it. This rhetoric echoes the “big‑stick” doctrine of earlier eras, yet pushes the lever from denial to direct appropriation. If sanctions are lifted, a single U.S. firm could target roughly one million barrels per day, worth $30 billion a year at $30 a barrel – a volume comparable to the United States’ own consumption. The strategic calculus therefore mirrors the early‑20th‑century trade relationship, where Venezuela supplied the bulk of U.S. oil imports, while also reflecting the contemporary politicisation of energy that has characterised presidential campaigns since Bush’s 2006 address.

Critics warn that the plan could exacerbate geopolitical tensions and provoke retaliatory measures from Russia, China and Iran, all of whom have vested interests in the Venezuelan oil sector. Moreover, the success of any extraction drive depends on the removal of U.S. sanctions on oil‑service equipment, substantial capital investment in upgrading the Orinoco Belt’s heavy crude, and a stable political environment free from renewed conflict.

In sum, Trump’s 2026 oil gambit revives a familiar U.S. playbook: leverage Venezuela’s hydrocarbon wealth to achieve energy security and exert political pressure. Whether the promise translates into tangible revenue for a beleaguered Venezuelan economy remains uncertain, but the potential $10‑$15 billion annual uplift underscores the enduring allure of the country’s $24 trillion oil prize.
