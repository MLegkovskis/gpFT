**The Venezuelan bolívar has slumped more than 90 % against the dollar since the United States imposed a maritime “partial blockade” in December 2025, leaving the country’s oil output poised to fall from roughly 1.2 million barrels a day to under 300 000 barrels and threatening a humanitarian crisis as export earnings evaporate.** 

The blockade, ordered by the Trump administration and retained by the subsequent Biden‑Trump transition team, authorises U.S. naval forces to board any tanker carrying Venezuelan crude to Asian markets or elsewhere. The *Washington Post* describes it as a step that could shutter more than 70 % of Venezuela’s oil production this year. Internal government estimates obtained by the *New York Times* in January 2026 suggest that, if the order remains in force, PDVSA’s daily output will tumble to less than 300 000 barrels, cutting export revenues by $12‑$15 billion – roughly half of the country’s 2023 oil‑export earnings. 

The financial fallout is already evident. The *Financial Times* reports the bolívar now trades at about 1 VES ≈ 0.00004 USD, a ten‑fold decline from a year earlier. The *New York Times* warns that the loss of oil cash will slash food‑import capacity by another 40 % by mid‑2026, raising the spectre of a full‑blown humanitarian emergency. 

This shock must be measured against the backdrop of a decade of U.S. sanctions that have gradually eroded Venezuela’s oil sector. Beginning in 2005 with targeted anti‑drug measures, the sanctions regime expanded in December 2014 with the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act, which revoked visas and froze assets of senior officials. In August 2017 sectoral sanctions under Executive Order 13808 cut PDVSA off from U.S. dollar financing, forcing reliance on costly Chinese loans. Subsequent actions – a digital‑currency ban (March 2018), a debt‑purchase prohibition (May 2018), and a full PDVSA asset freeze (January 2019) – stripped the state oil company of $7 billion in U.S. assets and halted sales to the United States. 

The cumulative impact of those measures was severe but incremental. From 2015 to 2019 PDVSA’s production fell from about 2.3 million to 800 000 barrels a day – a 65 % decline – and annual oil revenue shrank by $5‑$7 billion. Hyperinflation surged to roughly 1 000 % per year in 2018 and 2 000 % in 2019, while food and medicine imports dropped by more than 70 % between 2013 and 2016. The IMF estimates a 50 % contraction in real GDP from 2013 to 2020, with the World Bank attributing a third of that loss to sanctions‑related oil cuts. By early 2019 more than two million Venezuelans had fled, a migration wave accelerated by the sanctions wave of 2017‑2019. 

The 2025‑2026 blockade differs fundamentally from those earlier rounds. Earlier sanctions were principally financial – freezing assets, denying access to U.S. markets and secondary‑sanctioning non‑U.S. firms. The current order is a maritime enforcement tool that blocks the physical movement of oil worldwide, not merely to the United States. Consequently, the projected revenue loss of $12‑$15 billion dwarfs the $5‑$7 billion annual hit from the 2017‑2019 sanctions, and the bolívar’s 90 % devaluation in a single year eclipses the roughly 80 % loss recorded between 2015 and 2019. 

Both sanction regimes have precipitated oil‑production collapse, currency ruin and humanitarian distress, but the blockade represents the most acute economic pressure ever applied to Venezuela. Its rapid, large‑scale shock to export flows threatens to accelerate inflation, deepen shortages and push an already fragile population toward crisis at a pace that outstrips the gradual erosion of the previous decade. The international community now faces a stark choice: intensify diplomatic engagement to avert catastrophe or watch a once‑oil‑rich nation slip further into economic abyss.
