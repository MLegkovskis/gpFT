# Mexico Hit by Wave of Violence After Security Forces Kill Cartel Leader
## Introduction
Mexican security forces killed the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), 'El Mencho' (Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes), on February 22, 2026, in the town of Tapalpa, Jalisco. The operation sparked a wave of violence across at least eight states, with reports of burning vehicles, road blockades, and public-transport suspension.
## Immediate Aftermath
The killing of 'El Mencho' led to immediate retaliation from the CJNG, with vehicles being torched and highways blocked with burning cars. The violence spread across multiple states, including Jalisco, Guanajuato, Nayarit, Michoacán, Guerrero, Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas.
## Community Reactions
Local communities reacted with fear and self-protection, with many residents sheltering in place or evacuating the area. Tourists were advised to stay indoors or evacuate, and several airlines cancelled flights to Jalisco. Local business owners reported attacks on their shops, and public-transport operators suspended services statewide.
## Government and Authority Responses
The Mexican government responded quickly, with President Claudia Sheinbaum declaring 'absolute coordination' between federal and state governments and urging calm. The Secretariat of National Defence released official casualty figures and confirmed operation details, while the U.S. Department of State issued a travel advisory for U.S. citizens in the affected areas.
## Quantitative Impact
The violence resulted in at least 150 vehicles being torched, over 30 major road blockades, and 25 arrests. At least 12 civilians were injured, mostly from smoke inhalation and minor burns. Three major airlines cancelled flights to Jalisco, and approximately 1,200 foreign visitors were evacuated from the area.
## Conclusion
The killing of 'El Mencho' has sparked a significant wave of violence across Mexico, with the CJNG demonstrating its capacity to mobilize quickly in response to the loss of its leader. The Mexican government's swift response aims to contain the spill-over, but the situation remains volatile.
