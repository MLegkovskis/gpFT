**Can 2026 match the momentum of 2025?** The data suggest a sobering answer. While 2025 delivered solid real‑GDP growth of around 3.6‑3.8 % in the United States and a rally of roughly 15 % in the S&P 500, the outlook for 2026 points to slower expansion, a heightened recession risk and a modest equity outlook that falls short of the previous year’s highs.

The macro backdrop has already shifted. Global real GDP is projected to edge down from 3.2 % in 2025 to 3.1 % in 2026, and the United States’ annualised growth is expected to slip from the 2.1 % recorded in Q4 2025 to about 1.6 % by the end of next year. Core PCE inflation, still above the Federal Reserve’s 2 % target, is likely to hover around 3.2 % in 2026, only marginally higher than the 3.1 % forecast for the close of 2025. The labour market, which has already shown signs of weakening – average non‑farm payroll gains fell to 30 000 per month in the three months to August 2025 from a 2024 average of 168 000 – is expected to stabilise around a 4.5 % unemployment rate, a modest rise from the 4.3 % seen in mid‑2025.

Equity markets have already set a high bar. The S&P 500 posted a 14.8 % gain for the full year, the Nasdaq added 11.2 % in Q3, and the Russell 2000 surged 12 % in the same quarter. These double‑digit returns, driven by resilient corporate balance sheets and a wave of AI‑related capital expenditure, will be the benchmark against which 2026 performance is measured. Yet analysts at J.P. Morgan now assign a 35 % probability to a U.S. and global recession in 2026, a stark contrast to the optimism that characterised the post‑pandemic rebound of 2021.

Executive sentiment reflects this cautious tone. A McKinsey survey released in September 2025 notes that executives are now more likely to expect declining rather than improving global conditions – the first such shift since May 2020. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s policy stance has begun to ease after a series of hikes that lifted the policy rate to 5.25‑5.50 % through 2024; a modest 0.25 % cut in September 2025 marks the first easing move since 2022, but rates are still expected to sit near 5.00‑5.25 % in 2026.

For the “Unhedged” podcast, the question of a 2026‑2025 match will hinge on two benchmarks: the United States’ Q2‑2025 GDP growth of 3.8 % annualised and the S&P 500’s 14.8 % year‑to‑date gain. Any 2026 scenario delivering sub‑2 % GDP growth or equity returns below 5 % would signal a clear shortfall. Even with pockets of strength – such as continued AI investment and relatively low unemployment – the convergence of slower growth, lingering inflation and a non‑trivial recession risk makes a repeat of 2025’s performance unlikely.

In sum, the macro‑economic engine is losing steam, the labour market is losing momentum, and the equity rally is losing its tailwinds. While the market may still find opportunities, the consensus among forecasters, investors and policymakers points to a 2026 that will probably fall short of the high‑water marks set in 2025.
