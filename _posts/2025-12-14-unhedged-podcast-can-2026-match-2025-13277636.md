**2026 could eclipse 2025, but only if AI‑driven growth, easing inflation and modest rate cuts materialise – a view shared by most market strategists, yet tempered by lingering credit‑cycle risks.**  

The United States posted a modest 1.5 %‑2.0 % real‑GDP expansion in 2025, a “resilient” performance despite higher tariffs and a prolonged government shutdown【PIMCO】. AI‑powered investment accounted for roughly a third of that growth, while the S&P 500 delivered a 20 % gain carried over from 2024 and sat about 6 % above its February 2025 peak【Deloitte】. Core CPI eased to 3.0 % in 2025, but remained above the Fed’s comfort zone【PIMCO】.  

Forecasts for 2026 are more upbeat. Vanguard projects U.S. real‑GDP growth at 2.25 % and core inflation at 2.6 %【Vanguard】, while EY and S&P Global see growth near 2 %【EY】【S&P Global】. The consensus lift is attributed to continued AI‑related capital spending, a modest fiscal stimulus in early 2026 and a slight easing of policy rates【Vanguard】【EY】. Equity analysts expect “modest gains” with higher volatility; Edward Jones warns the market may expand more slowly【Edward Jones】.  

Internationally, the IMF still expects global real‑GDP growth to slip marginally from 3.2 % in 2025 to 3.1 % in 2026【IMF】, leaving the United States marginally above the world average. JPMorgan notes a growth‑impulse of ~0.6 % in October 2025, suggesting financial conditions are becoming more supportive【JPMorgan】, a trend that Vanguard expects to continue as rates ease【Vanguard】.  

Historical parallels sharpen the outlook. The early‑2000s saw U.S. growth hover around 2 % with inflation near 2‑3 % and a sharp equity correction after the dot‑com bust. The late‑1990s, by contrast, delivered 3‑4 % growth, lower inflation and a tech‑led rally of over 70 % in the S&P 500. 2025 mirrors the early‑2000s in growth pace and inflation, but diverges in the scale of AI‑driven productivity – roughly 50 % of GDP growth in H1 2025【JPMorgan】, a contribution unseen since the internet boom.  

The Unhedged Podcast hosts Ian Smith, Katie Martin and Rob Armstrong echo this mixed sentiment. Smith praised the “surprisingly durable” equity rally but warned of a possible “sharp rotation into value and commodities”【Unhedged】. Martin stressed a bias toward “boring, cash‑generating companies” over hype‑driven stocks【Unhedged】, while Armstrong warned that “credit‑cycle slowdown” could blunt any double‑digit returns【Unhedged】.  

Institutional forecasts are broadly bullish: J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley each project S&P 500 gains of 12‑14 % in 2026, citing AI‑driven earnings and modest rate cuts【J.P. Morgan】【Morgan Stanley】. ProShares notes broader market participation, with the Russell 2000 already out‑performing the S&P 500 since April 2025【ProShares】. Yet Schwab cautions that “there will be less room for further cuts” and that fixed‑income returns may be “solid but muted”【Schwab】.  

In sum, 2026 can match or modestly exceed 2025 if AI investment stays robust, inflation continues its descent and the Fed delivers gentle easing. The principal headwinds remain credit‑cycle fragility and sector‑specific over‑exposure, especially among the “Magnificent 7” where a Yahoo Finance poll predicts a split between outperformers and laggards【Yahoo Finance】. A diversified, inflation‑aware portfolio that balances quality earnings with selective AI exposure appears the prudent path forward.
