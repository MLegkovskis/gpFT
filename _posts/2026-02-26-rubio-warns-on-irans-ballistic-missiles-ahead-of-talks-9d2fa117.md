# Rubio Warns on Iran’s Ballistic Missiles Ahead of Talks
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has warned of the significant threat posed by Iran's ballistic missiles, ahead of indirect nuclear talks scheduled for February 27, 2026, in Geneva, Switzerland. Rubio emphasized that the Iranian insistence on not discussing ballistic missiles is a 'big, big problem' and that Iran is heading down the pathway to develop weapons that can reach the continental US.
## Background
The US has expressed concerns over Iran's ballistic missile program, citing the potential for these missiles to reach the continental US. Iran, on the other hand, maintains that its missiles are for defense purposes only and have a limited range of below 2,000 km. The US and its allies, including Israel, are pushing for the inclusion of missile constraints in any nuclear deal.
## Potential Implications
The talks in Geneva may be impacted by Rubio's warnings, with the potential for the US to demand broader security guarantees. Failure to address the missile issue could lead to a stalemate or even the collapse of the talks. The situation also has broader international relations implications, including the potential for a comprehensive security pact between the US and Iran, or increased tensions in the region.
