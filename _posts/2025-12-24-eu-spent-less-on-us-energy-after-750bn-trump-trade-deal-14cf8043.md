**EU’s post‑deal energy spend falls short of $750 bn pledge, underscoring a modest uptick rather than the dramatic surge promised by the 2025 Trump‑EU trade accord.** Customs data for the first twelve months after the agreement show the bloc importing roughly **US$120 bn** of American oil, LNG and nuclear fuel – about half of the **$250 bn a year** target and only a 20 % rise on the 2024 level of **US$90‑100 bn**. The shortfall has already prompted the European Commission to warn that tariff‑free access for U.S. goods could be reassessed if the spending commitment is not met.

The deal, signed in July 2025, was framed as a security‑driven response to the loss of Russian gas after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the EU would purchase an additional **$250 bn per year** of U.S. energy products through 2027, bringing the total commitment to **$750 bn** over three years. In return, the United States removed tariffs on American energy while retaining or imposing new duties on a range of European industrial goods, a move the U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai described as a “rebalancing” of the trans‑Atlantic trade relationship.

The numbers contrast sharply with the long‑term trajectory of EU‑U.S. energy trade. In 2004, U.S. energy exports to Europe were valued at **US$1.6 bn**, representing just **15.2 %** of total U.S. oil and LNG shipments. By 2024, that figure had risen to **US$90.8 bn**, with the EU’s share climbing to **30.5 %**. The growth was steady but incremental, driven by market forces and the EU’s gradual diversification away from Russian supplies. The 2025 deal was intended to accelerate this trend dramatically, projecting an annual import level of **$250 bn** – a more than two‑fold increase on the 2024 peak.

In practice, the first‑year spend of **≈ $120 bn** represents a **30 %** rise over 2024, far short of the **180 %** jump the deal envisaged. Analysts at GIS Reports Online note that the pledge would have tripled the EU’s annual imports, creating a structural break in the historical pattern. Instead, the modest increase suggests supply‑side constraints, budgetary limits, or implementation delays. The shortfall also raises questions about the conditionality embedded in von der Leyen’s remarks: “If the EU does not meet the $250 bn per year target, the Commission will re‑evaluate the tariff‑free access granted to U.S. goods.” 

Katherine Tai reinforced the U.S. stance, pledging to monitor the energy‑spending commitments and work with the European Commission to ensure the **$250 bn** purchases are delivered on schedule. She highlighted the broader economic upside, citing “millions of jobs” and lower energy costs for European consumers as direct benefits of the **$750 bn** energy purchase and **$600 bn** investment package.

The divergence between the pledged and actual figures has immediate policy implications. For the EU, failing to meet the target could trigger the re‑imposition of tariffs on European pharmaceuticals, automobiles and semiconductors, eroding the competitive advantage gained from the deal. For the United States, the shortfall undermines the narrative of a decisive trade‑balance correction and may prompt a more assertive enforcement posture.

In sum, the EU’s post‑deal energy spending confirms a continued upward trajectory but falls well short of the transformational leap promised in the 2025 Trump‑EU agreement. The episode illustrates the challenges of translating high‑level political commitments into concrete trade flows, especially when geopolitical imperatives intersect with market realities.
