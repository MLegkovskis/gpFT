**Kenya’s “crown‑jewel” privatisation – a $1 bn cash infusion that could reshape fiscal policy but raises sovereignty concerns**

The Treasury has launched the first tranche of a sweeping privatisation programme, selling a 65 % stake in Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) for an estimated **Sh 130 billion ($1.01 bn)**. The proceeds are earmarked to seed a sovereign‑wealth fund and an infrastructure fund, a move the government says will plug widening fiscal gaps and fund road, rail and dam projects. The deal follows a parallel 15 % sale of Safaricom to South Africa’s Vodacom Group, valued at **Sh 244.5 billion ($1.01 bn)**, together creating a “crown‑jewel” precedent for future disposals such as the planned KPC divestment worth up to $1 bn.

The KPC transaction is the largest single cash‑raising exercise in Kenya’s recent history. By contrast, the 2007 privatisation of Telkom Kenya – a 51 % sale to France Telecom for **US $390 million (≈ Sh 39 billion)** – generated roughly one‑sixth of the funds now being mobilised. The earlier deal was driven by a need to write‑off KSh 40 billion of debt and to unlock Telkom’s 60 % stake in Safaricom for a 2008 IPO that raised over KSh 50 billion. The 2025 sales, however, are framed as strategic revenue‑generating disposals under the newly enacted **Privatisation Act 2025**, rather than emergency debt‑relief measures. While the Telkom sale transferred majority control, the Safaricom deal dilutes the state’s holding from about 35 % to 20 %, preserving a significant minority stake.

Economically, the $1 bn injection represents roughly 0.8 % of Kenya’s nominal GDP (≈ $120 bn) and is projected to contribute **0.5‑0.6 percentage points** to annual growth. Kenya’s real GDP expanded to **5.0 % YoY in Q2 2025**, up from 4.6 % a year earlier, and the World Bank has lifted its 2025 growth forecast to **4.9 %**. Analysts argue that while the cash boost will not single‑handedly drive the quarterly surge, it will reinforce the fiscal base and enable infrastructure spending that underpins the observed upturn.

The privatisation drive has provoked sharp criticism from opposition politicians and business leaders. Wiper Party leader **Kalonzo Musyoka** warned that the Safaricom sale “undermines constitutional requirements for public participation” and serves private interests at the expense of national control. Former Deputy President **Rigathi Gachagua** framed the broader agenda as a systematic “selling of all national institutions”, raising fears of lost strategic autonomy in telecommunications, energy transport and food processing. Both have pledged to block the transactions and to reverse them if the opposition wins the 2027 elections.

From the private sector, political‑risk analyst **Dismas Mokua** cautioned that the government is “cornered” into privatisation because it cannot raise taxes or borrow without political backlash. He stressed that the proceeds must be insulated from short‑term political spending; otherwise the cash infusion merely replaces debt servicing without addressing the underlying fiscal imbalance. Kenyan business bodies such as KEPSA have called for a transparent, competitive bidding process and for the funds to be ring‑fenced for agriculture, energy and infrastructure projects, warning that any diversion to patronage would erode investor confidence and raise future financing costs.

The twin sales of Safaricom and KPC thus mark a pivotal shift in Kenya’s fiscal strategy: from debt‑relief rescues to strategic asset monetisation. Whether the proceeds will be deployed to generate sustainable growth or become a one‑off patch for a strained budget remains the central question as Kenya navigates the tension between immediate fiscal relief and long‑term economic sovereignty.
