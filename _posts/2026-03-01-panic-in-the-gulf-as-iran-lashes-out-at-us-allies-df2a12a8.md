# Panic in the Gulf as Iran lashes out at US allies
The Gulf region is on high alert after Iran launched a series of ballistic missiles at US allies in response to a joint US-Israeli air strike campaign. The US and its allies have responded with a mix of military action and diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation.
## US and Allied Response
The US and Israel launched a massive air strike campaign against Iranian military sites, missile depots, and nuclear-related facilities on February 28, 2026. The US Navy has also deployed two aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald R. Ford and the USS Abraham Lincoln, to the Arabian Sea/Oman, along with two Aegis-equipped destroyers and four P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft.
## Iranian Retaliation
Iran has launched approximately 40 ballistic missiles at Israeli targets and US bases in the Gulf, with around 12 intercepted by Patriot/THAAD systems in the Gulf. Five missiles reportedly hit US-operated airbases in Bahrain and Kuwait.
## Diplomatic Efforts
Diplomatic talks are underway to negotiate a cease-fire and reopen the Strait of Hormuz. The US, EU, and Oman are working together to draft a temporary maritime security protocol for the Strait of Hormuz, to be presented to the UN Security Council by mid-March. A three-day emergency summit is also scheduled to take place in Geneva from March 3-5.
