**Tencent’s $2.5 bn gamble on Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs, routed through Japan, adds $300 m to Nvidia’s Q4 2025 revenue and underscores the Chinese tech giant’s relentless push for AI dominance despite U.S. export bans.** 

The deal, announced on 14 December 2025, sees Tencent Holdings – via Japanese cloud‑service provider Datasection – purchase 15,000 of Nvidia’s flagship Blackwell B2 and B3 GPUs for data‑centres in Osaka and Sydney. Valued at roughly US $2.5 bn, the transaction is expected to lift Nvidia’s fiscal Q4 2025 topline by about US $300 m, a 2 % increase. By locating the hardware outside mainland China, Tencent sidesteps the U.S. restriction that bars direct sales of Blackwell chips to Chinese customers, keeping the most advanced inference engines within reach of its sprawling AI services.

The move fits neatly into a broader trajectory of Tencent’s AI‑hardware spending. After launching its home‑grown Hunyuan large‑language model in March 2023, the firm accelerated investments in 2024, integrating models such as Zhipu, Baichuan and DeepSeek into its cloud portfolio. In October 2024 Tencent Cloud began offering Nvidia A100 GPUs for AI‑as‑a‑Service, establishing a proven partnership with the U.S. chipmaker. A surge in R&D outlays – 21 % YoY to ¥18.9 bn in Q1 2025 – and a 119 % YoY jump in AI‑and‑cloud capex to ¥19.1 bn in Q2 2025 gave Tencent the financial firepower to pursue a work‑around when the Blackwell family fell under export controls. The company earmarked ¥90 bn of FY 2025 capex for AI hardware, a budget that comfortably accommodates the Blackwell purchase via Datasection’s three‑year contract, with plans to scale beyond 100 000 GPUs in the longer term.

Analysts view the arrangement as a modest but meaningful mitigation of the China ban. Goldman Sachs, in a client note dated 12 December 2025, warned that “little clarity on future licensing” keeps Nvidia’s growth outlook uncertain, even as the Tencent‑Japan channel provides a partial offset to the export restriction. Morgan Stanley, however, sees the deal as evidence of Nvidia’s enduring moat. The firm argues that the full‑stack AI platform – hardware, software and developer ecosystem – remains unrivalled, and that the indirect supply of Blackwell GPUs will preserve Nvidia’s pricing power and limit any near‑term upside for rivals. AMD’s October 2025 partnership with OpenAI, which grants the U.S. AI leader a 10 % stake in AMD, is deemed insufficient to erode Nvidia’s lead, while Intel’s $5 bn equity tie‑up with Nvidia is described as a “positive development overall but benefits are at the margin.” 

Both houses agree that Nvidia’s FY 2025 revenue guidance – $52.5 bn to $55 bn – dwarfs AMD’s projected $23 bn and Intel’s roughly $15 bn data‑center earnings, reinforcing the competitive gap. The Tencent‑Japan workaround keeps Nvidia’s high‑end AI supply chain active, sustaining its dominance in a market where performance per watt and a mature software stack are decisive. For Tencent, the Blackwell GPUs are the logical next step after the A100‑based services launched in 2024, enabling its home‑grown LLMs to serve WeChat, gaming and advertising workloads with lower latency and cost.

In short, the $2.5 bn Blackwell purchase illustrates how Tencent is willing to engineer complex cross‑border supply chains to stay at the cutting edge of AI, while Nvidia benefits from a fresh revenue stream that cushions the impact of U.S. export controls. The arrangement also signals that, for now, competitors such as AMD and Intel will remain in Nvidia’s shadow, their strategic partnerships offering only incremental gains against a company that continues to lock in the most advanced silicon through inventive, if legally compliant, channels.
