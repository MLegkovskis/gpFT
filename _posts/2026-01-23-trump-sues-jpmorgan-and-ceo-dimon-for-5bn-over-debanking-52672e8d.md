# Trump Sues JPMorgan and CEO Dimon for $5 Billion Over Debanking
The lawsuit alleges that JPMorgan closed Trump's accounts for political reasons. The incident may have significant implications for the banking sector's revenue in 2026.
## Potential Impact on Banking Sector Revenue
The debanking incident could affect the banking sector's revenue through various channels, including:
* Reputational spill-over: High-profile lawsuit raises public perception that large banks may close accounts for political reasons
* Regulatory tightening: Stricter 'political-bias' prohibitions and higher compliance costs
* Litigation-related provisions: Banks may set aside larger reserves for potential lawsuits
* Competitive market response: Rival banks and fintechs may launch 'politically neutral' account products
* Media-driven consumer behavior: Continuous coverage keeps the issue in the public eye, amplifying the 'risk of political discrimination' narrative
## Aggregate Estimate
The estimated net revenue reduction for the banking sector in 2026 is roughly $25-35 billion, i.e., 0.5-0.8% of the projected $4.6 trillion global banking-sector revenue.
