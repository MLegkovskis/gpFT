The Washington Post's recent job cuts and the resignation of publisher and CEO Will Lewis reflect the broader financial struggles in the media industry. The Post laid off approximately 300 journalists, roughly 30% of its newsroom staff, in a move that mirrors the average layoff rate reported across U.S. daily newspapers in 2024-25. This scale of layoffs is a symptom of the revenue pressure faced by the industry, driven by declining print ad dollars and subscriber churn. 

 The Post's subscriber loss after the 2024 endorsement reversal, approximately 5% of its base, is part of a wider trend where many legacy papers saw 4-7% subscriber attrition after editorial or pricing changes. The shift to digital and AI experimentation is a common strategy among media groups to offset shrinking ad revenue. 

 Lewis's focus on 'alternative sources of revenue' and AI-driven products reflects this strategy, which is also being pursued by other media companies, such as The New York Times. However, the rapid replacement of Lewis with a CFO-turned-publisher signals that financial stewardship is now a primary qualification for top media executives, a shift seen across the industry. 

 The Washington Post's cuts and leadership change are a microcosm of the wider financial squeeze hitting U.S. journalism, with falling ad revenue, subscriber volatility, and a strategic pivot to digital/AI-driven products driving aggressive cost-cutting and leadership changes.
