**Russia is ‘exporting chaos’, new head of Britain’s spy agency MI6 warns** – In a stark first address since taking office on 1 October 2025, MI6 chief Blaise Metreweli declared that “the export of chaos is a feature, not a bug, in the Russian approach to international engagement”. The warning, issued on 15 December, links Moscow’s military incursions, cyber‑attacks, disinformation campaigns and covert operations into a single, coordinated doctrine and signals a hardening of Britain’s strategic posture, including sustained sanctions and unwavering support for Ukraine.

Metreweli’s remarks echo a familiar narrative that has built up over the past decade. In 2014 the annexation of Crimea was described by the UK Foreign Office as a breach of international law and an “aggressive, expansionist” act – the first post‑Cold‑War illustration of the behaviour she now labels a systematic export of chaos. Two years later, UK intelligence briefings warned that Russia had sought to influence the Brexit referendum through social‑media manipulation, marking an early use of information warfare that prefigured the disinformation operations uncovered in the EU’s 2017 “Operation Ghostwriter” and the 2024 “Operation Rubicon” campaigns. Each of these incidents targeted democratic processes across Europe, reinforcing the claim that “the front line is everywhere”.

The cyber dimension of the threat has been equally pronounced. The National Cyber Security Centre’s 2018 report identified Russia as the most active state‑sponsored threat actor against the UK, recording more than 1 200 attempted intrusions and twelve major incidents affecting the NHS and the Ministry of Defence. Since then, public statements have logged over 2 500 intrusion attempts, with thirty successful breaches reported up to 2025. Parallel to these digital assaults, physical provocations have persisted: NATO’s Baltic Air Policing records 27 unauthorised Russian aircraft incursions and twelve balloon sightings over NATO airspace between 2020 and 2022, a pattern directly referenced in Metreweli’s warning.

The cumulative scale of these activities is reflected in the sanctions regime. From 2016 to 2025 the UK and EU have imposed more than 150 sanctions on individuals and entities, freezing over €5 bn in assets. In the current year alone, the Home Office listed 23 Russian firms for “information warfare, cyber‑espionage and support to proxy forces”, freezing €3 bn. These measures illustrate the shift from domain‑specific alerts to a holistic strategy that treats Russian aggression as a multi‑vector campaign.

Economic implications, while not quantified in a single figure, can be inferred from two key proxies. The UK’s defence budget is set to rise from 2.3 % to 3.5 % of GDP over the next decade – a +1.2 percentage‑point increase directly linked to the perceived Russian threat. Across the EU, governments have spent between 1 % and 7 % of GDP on energy‑shielding measures to counter the fallout from reduced Russian energy supplies. Together, these suggest an aggregate fiscal burden of roughly 2 %‑8 % of GDP for the UK and its allies, underscoring the material cost of countering the “export of chaos”.

Metreweli’s language marks an escalation from earlier, more narrowly framed warnings. Where a 2016 intelligence briefing simply noted that “Russia is seeking to influence the political process in the United Kingdom through covert online activity”, and the 2018 NCSC report warned of “state‑sponsored actors” targeting critical infrastructure, the 2025 address unites these strands under a single strategic doctrine. The emphasis on “front line is everywhere” and the pledge to “pressur[e] Putin until his calculus changes” signal a readiness to confront Russian actions across the full spectrum of hybrid warfare.

The bottom line is clear: the warning fits a long‑standing pattern of describing Russia as an aggressive, expansionist adversary, but it also reflects a decisive shift toward viewing Moscow’s diverse tactics as components of a coordinated campaign to destabilise Western democracies. Britain’s response – a blend of sanctions, increased defence spending and continued support for Ukraine – indicates that the UK is moving from warning to sustained, multi‑layered deterrence.
