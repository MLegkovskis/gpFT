  - "Saba Capital's tender offer for Blue Owl BDCs may provide liquidity relief, but at a 20-35% discount to NAV, potentially re-pricing OWL shares lower."
  - "The acquisition's impact on revenue is modest, with Blue Owl's FY 2026 revenue expected to rise by approximately 1-3%."
  - "The effect on U.S. GDP is statistically negligible, adding less than 0.001% to financial-services output."

### Saba Capital's Tender Offer for Blue Owl BDCs
Saba Capital Management and Cox Capital Partners have launched a cash tender offer for three Blue Owl non-traded BDCs. The tender-offer price is expected to be 20-35% below the most recent estimated Net Asset Value (NAV) and dividend-reinvestment price of each BDC.

### Market Reaction and Analyst View
The announcement produced a small positive bump (+2.2%) in OWL's share price in extended trading, reflecting relief that a liquidity option is now available. However, analysts expect the market to re-price OWL shares lower if the tender-offer price lands at the high end of the discount range.

### Revenue Impact
The acquisition will bring a modest increase in revenue for both Blue Owl and Saba Capital. Blue Owl's FY 2026 revenue is expected to rise by approximately 1-3%, while Saba Capital's fee revenue may increase by $6-9 million.

### GDP Impact
The effect on U.S. GDP is statistically negligible, adding less than 0.001% to financial-services output.

### Conclusion
The tender offer provides liquidity relief, but its impact on revenue and GDP is modest. The market's reaction will depend on the final offer price and the perceived value of the BDCs.
