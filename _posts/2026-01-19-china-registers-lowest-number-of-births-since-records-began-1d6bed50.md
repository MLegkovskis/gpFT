# China's Birth Rate Drops to Record Low
China's birth rate has plummeted to its lowest level on record, with only 7.92 million births in 2025. This decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including the lasting impact of the one-child policy, economic pressures, and shifting cultural values.
## Primary Factors Contributing to the Decline
The primary factors driving this decline include:
* The legacy of the one-child policy, which has created a cultural norm of small families and reduced fertility expectations.
* Economic pressure and high child-rearing costs, which make having children unaffordable for many couples.
* A decline in marriage rates, which is a strong predictor of child-bearing in China.
* An aging population, which reduces the pool of potential parents and raises the dependency ratio.
* Cultural shifts toward individualism and career focus, which reduce the willingness to have larger families.
## Government Measures to Address the Low Birth Rate
The Chinese government has introduced various measures to address the low birth rate, including:
* Cash subsidies and tax breaks for families with children.
* Extended maternity leave and paternity leave.
* Coverage of assisted reproductive technology (ART) under basic medical insurance.
* Priority allocation of affordable rental units to households with multiple children.
However, these efforts have been insufficient to reverse the trend, and the birth rate continues to decline.
