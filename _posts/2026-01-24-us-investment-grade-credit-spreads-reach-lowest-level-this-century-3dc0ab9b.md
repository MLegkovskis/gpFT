### US Investment-Grade Credit Spreads Reach Historic Lows
The US investment-grade credit spreads have reached their lowest level this century, driven by a combination of factors including low net issuance, strong investor demand, and favorable macro-policy expectations. According to Guggenheim, the spreads have tightened to around 287 basis points, nearing their 2021 lows.

The factors driving this decline include very low net issuance, with refinancing driving 72% of primary market activity, and strong investor demand, which has continued to tighten spreads towards the lows last seen in 2021. Additionally, Fed easing expectations and robust economic data have contributed to the decline in spreads.

The convergence of supply scarcity, strong demand, and improving credit quality has created a classic 'tight-spread' environment, with each element reinforcing the others. The result is the current historic low in US investment-grade credit spreads, which is expected to have a positive impact on the overall bond market.
