### Trump Tariffs Ruling and Response
The Supreme Court of the United States made a significant ruling on February 20, 2026, in the case *Learning Resources, Inc. v. United States*, determining that President Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) when imposing sweeping global tariffs. The court held that IEEPA does not grant the President blanket power to impose tariffs based on a national-security emergency. 

In a 6-3 decision, with the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court emphasized that when Congress delegates its tariff powers, it does so in explicit terms and subject to strict limits. This ruling effectively invalidated the IEEPA-based tariffs, which accounted for roughly half of the revenue generated by Trump's global tariff program. 

In response to the ruling, President Trump announced a new 10% global levy, stating he would 'go in a different direction' and that the levy would be 'even stronger' than the previously struck-down tariffs. This new levy is based on Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which the administration believes provides the necessary authority for the 'global-tariff' framework.
