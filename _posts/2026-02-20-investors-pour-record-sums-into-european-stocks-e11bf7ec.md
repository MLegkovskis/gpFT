# Record Investments in European Stocks
European stocks have seen a surge in investments, with €62.3 billion in net inflows in 2025. This trend is driven by a combination of factors, including a valuation discount compared to US stocks, strong earnings upgrades, and policy-driven growth in the defence and energy sectors.
## Key Drivers
* **Defence-spending surge**: Germany's pledge to increase defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2029 has created a tailwind for defence contractors like Rheinmetall AG.
* **AI-infrastructure demand**: Growth in AI-related infrastructure has boosted demand for Siemens Energy AG's products, including turbines and grid solutions.
* **Valuation discount**: The EURO STOXX 50 trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18.3, compared to 27.7 for the S&P 500, making European stocks more attractive to investors.
## Market Reaction
The record investments have led to significant gains for European stocks, with the EURO STOXX 50 and DAX indices returning 22.1% and 23% in 2025, respectively. Rheinmetall AG and Siemens Energy AG have been the biggest beneficiaries, with price gains of 154% and 139% in 2025.
## Economic Implications
The surge in investments is expected to have a positive impact on the European economy, with the potential to drive growth and create jobs. However, there are also risks associated with the trend, including the potential for overvaluation and market volatility.
