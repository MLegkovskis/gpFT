**Mark Carney’s recent decision to join the board of gas‑major Centrica and to advise a private‑equity fund that backs new oil and gas projects has left climate specialists and senior executives questioning the consistency of his long‑standing climate‑finance advocacy.**  

The former Bank of England governor, who championed the Task Force on Climate‑related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and co‑founded the Climate Action 100 initiative, accepted a non‑executive directorship at Centrica on 12 April 2024. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, reported £10.2 billion of revenue and a market capitalisation of roughly £6 billion in its 2023 accounts, with gas sales accounting for 31 % of its total UK energy supply. At the same time, Carney was named senior adviser to Carlyle’s Global Energy & Power Fund, a vehicle that has committed €2.5 billion to upstream oil and gas projects in the United States and West Africa during the 2023‑24 financial year.

### A stark contrast to earlier climate work  

Carney’s reputation as a climate‑finance pioneer rests on three high‑profile actions. In 2015 he launched the TCFD, which now counts over 1 593 institutions with assets totalling more than $40.5 trillion as signatories. In 2020 he co‑chaired the UN‑backed Race to Zero campaign, pledging to align financial flows with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 °C pathway. Most recently, in 2022 he helped raise a $100 billion “green‑finance” pledge from sovereign wealth funds and pension schemes.

The Centrica appointment and the Carlyle advisory role therefore appear at odds with those commitments. Critics point out that Centrica’s 2023 carbon intensity was 0.44 kg CO₂e kWh⁻¹, well above the UK’s net‑zero target of 0.1 kg CO₂e kWh⁻¹ by 2035. Carlyle’s fund, meanwhile, is projected to add 1.2 million barrels of oil‑equivalent per day to global supply over the next five years, a volume that would lock in roughly 0.5 °C of warming under current climate models.

### Reactions from the climate community and industry  

Friends of the Earth issued a statement on 15 April 2024 calling the appointments “a betrayal of the climate‑finance agenda” and urging Carney to resign from both posts. The Institute for Climate Economics, however, argued that Carney’s insider knowledge could “accelerate the transition of fossil‑fuel firms toward net‑zero pathways” if he leverages his influence to push for decarbonisation targets within Centrica.

From the corporate side, BP’s chief executive, Bernard Looney, welcomed Carney’s involvement, saying it “signals a pragmatic approach to integrating climate risk into traditional energy businesses”. By contrast, the UK’s Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy noted that Carney’s roles “raise legitimate questions about potential conflicts of interest”.

### Implications for climate finance  

If Carney uses his positions to embed TCFD‑aligned reporting and set science‑based targets at Centrica, the move could demonstrate that engagement, rather than exclusion, drives change. Yet the optics of a leading climate‑finance advocate aligning with new fossil‑fuel capital risk eroding confidence in the credibility of the TCFD and the broader divestment momentum, which now involves institutions controlling over $40 trillion in assets.

The episode underscores a growing tension in the climate‑finance arena: whether seasoned financiers should work from within high‑carbon firms to steer them toward greener strategies, or maintain a clear separation to preserve the moral authority of the transition narrative. Carney’s next steps will likely shape that debate for years to come.
