**Mark Carney’s sudden embrace of new fossil‑fuel projects – from “de‑carbonised” oil pipelines to expanded carbon‑capture schemes – has left climate specialists and senior executives questioning whether the former Bank of England governor‑turned‑Canadian prime minister has abandoned the climate agenda he helped build.**  

## A rapid policy reversal  

Within weeks of taking office in March 2025, Carney ordered the federal consumer carbon price – which had cut annual emissions by an estimated 8‑14 Mt CO₂e, according to the Canadian Climate Institute – to be repealed from 1 April.  At the same time he announced a $16 million boost for energy projects in the Maritimes, half of which is earmarked for carbon‑capture pilots that will be tied to new oil‑sand extraction licences.  The move follows a June meeting in Saskatoon where Carney spoke of “de‑carbonised oil” as a viable component of Canada’s future energy mix, a phrase widely dismissed by the clean‑energy sector as a marketing ploy.  

## Emissions data under pressure  

Federal inventories released in March show that oil‑and‑gas emissions rose 7 % between 2005 and 2023, while oil‑sand output‑related emissions jumped more than 140 % over the same period.  By contrast, Canada’s hydroelectric generation fell 5.1 % in 2024 to 343.2 TWh, and wind‑solar‑storage capacity grew 46 % since 2019, adding roughly 24 GW of new renewable capacity.  Yet the carbon‑capture projects currently in operation trap only 0.5 % of national emissions, most of which is redirected to enhanced oil recovery rather than permanent storage.  

## Industry and expert reaction  

Toronto‑based pension‑monitoring group Shift’s director Adam Scott warned that “de‑carbonised oil” is scientifically untenable: the bulk of oil’s climate impact stems from end‑use combustion, which CCS cannot offset at scale.  Citizens’ Climate Lobby Canada’s Cathy Orlando called the pipeline and CCS push a “fairy‑tale” that risks diverting capital from proven clean‑tech solutions.  Data from Environmental Defence shows Carney has met with 25 oil‑and‑gas lobbyists in his first five months, a stark contrast to the 450‑plus financial firms that once signed up to the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) under his leadership.  

## Global context  

Internationally, renewable investment reached $2 trillion in 2024 – $800 billion more than in fossil fuels – and on‑shore wind and solar are now 53 % and 41 % cheaper than the cheapest coal generation, respectively (IRENA).  The UN’s latest reports warn that each additional gigatonne of CO₂ emitted adds roughly $233 billion to projected global climate damages, underscoring the economic risk of a policy backslide.  

## Outlook  

Carney’s dual track – championing “clean‑energy superpower” rhetoric while unlocking new fossil‑fuel capacity – places Canada at a crossroads.  If the promised CCS and “de‑carbonised” oil fail to deliver measurable emissions cuts, the pivot could erode investor confidence, stall the rapid renewable expansion already underway, and jeopardise Canada’s ability to meet its 2030 net‑zero target.  The coming months will test whether Carney can reconcile economic imperatives with the hard‑numbers climate science demands.
