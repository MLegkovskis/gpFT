# Ukraine's Economy Shows Resilience Amid Ongoing War
Ukraine's economy has demonstrated remarkable grit and resilience in the face of ongoing war damage. After a significant decline of 29% in 2022, the economy rebounded with 5.3% growth in 2023, followed by 3.6% growth in 2024. The projected growth for 2025 is 2.2%, indicating a continued positive trend.
## Key Industries' Performance
Agriculture is expected to generate $45 billion in gross production value and $22-23 billion in export earnings in 2026. Manufacturing, overall, is forecasted to contribute $30 billion, with $60 billion coming from the rapidly expanding defence-manufacturing sector. Non-defence industrial output is expected to be around $15-20 billion.
## Economic Outlook
The economy is expected to continue growing, driven by defence production, reconstruction, and foreign financial support. However, the ongoing war damage and structural issues in energy, transport, and industrial assets are likely to cap the pace of growth.
