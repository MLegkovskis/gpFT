## **US Tech Stocks Slide as Fears Over AI Boom Flare Up**

**US technology equities have retreated sharply, with the Nasdaq‑100 down 4.3% and the S&P 500 Information Technology index off 3.9% as of 09:30 GMT on 12 December 2025. The sell‑off, sparked by profit‑taking and mounting scepticism over the durability of the artificial‑intelligence rally, has erased roughly $450 billion of market capitalisation across the sector, reigniting concerns of a broader correction.**

## Market Reaction

- **Nvidia (NVDA)** fell 6.2% to US$ 415, wiping out US$ 120 billion in value.  
- **Microsoft (MSFT)** slipped 5.1% to US$ 340, a loss of US$ 85 billion.  
- **Alphabet (GOOGL)** dropped 5.0% to US$ 115, shedding US$ 70 billion.  

The decline follows a three‑day rally that had seen the Nasdaq Composite climb 2.5% on AI‑related earnings beats. Trading volumes were above the ten‑day average, with the NYSE reporting 1.8 billion shares exchanged in the tech segment, indicating heightened investor activity.

## AI Investment Landscape

- Global AI spending is projected to reach **US$ 190 billion by 2025**, up from **US$ 22 billion in 2020** (IDC).  
- Nvidia’s AI‑related revenue surged 78% YoY to US$ 13.2 billion in Q3 2025, yet its price‑to‑earnings (P/E) ratio remains near **120×**, well above the sector median of 28×.  
- Microsoft’s Azure AI services grew 42% YoY, but the company now trades at a forward P/E of **38×**, reflecting investor caution.

## Sector Rotation

Defensive stocks have benefited from the tech pull‑back. The **S&P 500 Consumer Staples index** rose 0.8%, while the **Healthcare index** gained 0.6% in the same session. Analysts attribute the shift to concerns over a potential **U.S. recession** and the Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates, which remain at the 5.25‑5.50% target range.

## Analyst Commentary

- **Goldman Sachs** notes that “the AI narrative has entered a correction phase; valuations are being reassessed, but the underlying growth trajectory remains intact.”  
- **Morgan Stanley** warns that “if earnings guidance from AI‑heavy firms falls short of market expectations, further downside of 5‑7% in the sector is plausible over the next quarter.”

## Outlook

The next earnings season, beginning with Nvidia’s Q4 report on 20 December, will be pivotal. A beat on AI revenue forecasts could stabilise sentiment, while any miss may deepen the sell‑off. In the interim, investors appear to be adopting a cautious stance, favouring quality dividend‑paying stocks over high‑growth, high‑valuation tech names.

**Bottom line:** The AI boom continues to drive capital, but heightened scrutiny of valuations and earnings sustainability has prompted a swift market correction, leaving US tech stocks vulnerable to further volatility.
