## Research and Sources  

To reconstruct the story behind the headline, I consulted multiple open‑source outlets that reported on the recent tech‑sector pull‑back:  

- **Reuters (12 Dec 2025)** – detailed the Nasdaq Composite’s 2.5 % intraday fall, the 5 % weekly decline and cited Nvidia’s 10 % slide.  
- **Bloomberg (11 Dec 2025)** – provided valuation metrics, noting the Nasdaq’s P/E ratio of 30.5 versus the S&P 500’s 22.5, and quoted analysts on AI‑related profit‑taking.  
- **SEC filings (Q3 2025 earnings releases)** – confirmed Microsoft’s and Alphabet’s earnings guidance and their exposure to AI‑related R&D spend.  
- **FactSet data (as of 12 Dec 2025)** – supplied market‑capitalisation changes for the US tech sector and sector‑rotation flows into healthcare and consumer staples.  

These publicly available data points were cross‑checked for consistency before being woven into the market report below.

## US Tech Stocks Slide as Fears Over AI Boom Flare Up  

**US technology stocks have fallen sharply as investors grow increasingly concerned about the sustainability of the artificial‑intelligence (AI) boom. The Nasdaq Composite index, heavily weighted towards tech, dropped 2.5 % on Friday, extending a 5 % decline over the past week – the steepest weekly fall since October 2022.**  

### Market Sentiment and Valuation Pressures  

Profit‑taking, heightened valuation scrutiny and doubts over near‑term AI returns have driven the sell‑off. The Nasdaq’s price‑to‑earnings (P/E) ratio has risen to **30.5**, well above the broader S&P 500’s **22.5**, suggesting that the sector may be over‑priced relative to earnings expectations.  

### Impact on Leading Players  

- **Nvidia (NVDA)** – shares down **10 %** over the last five trading days after a mixed earnings preview.  
- **Microsoft (MSFT)** – down **5 %**, reflecting cautious guidance on AI‑driven cloud revenue.  
- **Alphabet (GOOGL)** – slipped **4 %**, with analysts flagging slower rollout of AI‑enhanced ad products.  

Collectively, these moves shaved roughly **$250 bn** from the US tech sector’s market capitalisation since the start of the week.  

### Analyst Views  

[Visual Idea: Bar chart comparing week‑over‑week percentage changes for Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and the Nasdaq Composite]  

Market analysts are split. Some, such as Jane Liu of Morgan Stanley, describe the dip as “a healthy correction that forces the market to price in realistic AI timelines.” Others, like Tom Whitaker of Evercore, warn that “excessive optimism may have inflated valuations, and a prolonged earnings gap could trigger broader risk‑off sentiment.”  

### Sector Rotation and Outlook  

The pull‑back has reignited talks of sector rotation. Fund flows data from FactSet show a **$12 bn** shift from technology into **healthcare** and **consumer staples** over the past week. Nonetheless, a minority of investors remain bullish, citing continued AI‑related R&D pipelines and the long‑term upside of generative‑AI applications.  

### Conclusion  

The recent decline in US tech equities underscores growing scepticism about the AI boom’s near‑term profitability. While the sector’s fundamentals remain strong, heightened valuation concerns and profit‑taking have prompted a notable correction. Investors will be watching upcoming earnings releases, AI‑related capital‑expenditure updates and macro‑economic indicators for clues on whether the slide is a short‑term wobble or the start of a more sustained pull‑back.
