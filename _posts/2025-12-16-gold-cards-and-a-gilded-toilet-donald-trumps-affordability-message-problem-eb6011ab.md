# ‘Gold cards’ and a gilded toilet: Donald Trump’s affordability message problem 

**Donald Trump’s latest bid to sell America as a land of opportunity – a $5 million “Gold Card” visa and a tongue‑in‑cheek offer of an 18‑karat gold‑plated toilet – has back‑fired spectacularly, eroding his support among low‑income voters even as the nation’s economy posts a modest 2 % annualised growth rate in the second quarter of 2025.** 

The United States economy is expanding at an annualised 2.10 % in Q2 2025, a figure that eclipses the Obama‑era average of 1.62 % and sits comfortably above the sub‑1 % pace recorded during Trump’s first term. Quarter‑over‑quarter growth of 3.80 % also outstrips any single‑quarter surge seen under President Obama. Yet the President’s narrative of “affordability for all” is being undermined by policy proposals that appear to privilege the ultra‑wealthy. 

Announced on 2 March 2025, the “Gold Card” visa would grant permanent residency to investors who can deposit $5 million in a U.S. bank. Democrats were swift to condemn the scheme as a pay‑to‑play affront to meritocracy. Representative Ro Khanna (D‑CA) warned that success does not require a multi‑million bankroll, citing tech founders such as Sergey Brin and Satya Nadella. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D‑NY) called the plan a “reckless, unconstitutional grab for campaign cash,” while Alexandria Ocasio‑Cortez (D‑NY) branded it a “joke” that ignored families struggling to pay rent. 

Republican reactions were mixed. Senate Minority Leader Rand Paul (R‑KY) described the proposal as “reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible,” echoing concerns about the dilution of citizenship. Ted Cruz (R‑TX) and other Senate leaders argued that any new visa category must pass through Congress, signalling procedural unease. By contrast, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R‑LA) defended the measure as a pro‑business, job‑creating initiative, and Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D‑CA) warned that selling citizenship to the highest bidder could provoke political backlash. 

The controversy was amplified by the resurfacing of a 2018 episode in which the Guggenheim Museum offered the White House an 18‑karat gold‑plated toilet as a satirical critique of excess. Although the offer was rejected, progressive Democrats such as Rep. Ilhan Omar (D‑MN) seized on the story to question Trump’s empathy for low‑income Americans, while Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham (R‑SC) dismissed it as media distraction, insisting the public cares about jobs, not bathroom décor. 

Pollsters have quantified the political cost. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey fielded 12‑10 March 2025 recorded a 22 % favorability rating for Trump among households earning under $40 k, a seven‑point drop from the previous week’s 29 % after the Gold Card announcement. Pew Research’s 15 March 2025 “Economic Outlook” poll showed a five‑point decline in voting intention among the same income bracket, with “affordability‑concern” responses rising from 31 % to 44 %. YouGov’s 18 March “Morning‑After” poll echoed the trend, noting that the gold‑card and gilded‑toilet narratives were the top‑mentioned reasons for reduced support. All three surveys, conducted after the Gold Card proposal and the revived toilet story, indicate a statistically significant erosion of Trump’s appeal to the demographic he claims to champion. 

The emerging picture is one of stark contrast: a growing economy that, by conventional metrics, outperforms the Obama years, and a political strategy that appears increasingly out of touch with the financial realities of ordinary Americans. While Republican leaders continue to debate the procedural merits of the visa scheme, the Democratic narrative of elitist excess is resonating with voters who feel left behind. Unless the administration can reconcile its wealth‑centric proposals with a credible affordability message, the gap between macro‑economic performance and electoral support may widen further.
