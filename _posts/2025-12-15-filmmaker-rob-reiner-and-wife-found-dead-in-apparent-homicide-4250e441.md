**Rob Reiner and his wife Michele Singer Reiner were found dead on Sunday, 14 December 2025, in their Brentwood home, with police treating the case as an apparent homicide involving multiple stab wounds and no sign of forced entry.** The Los Angeles Police Department’s Robbery‑Homicide Division has taken charge of the investigation, while the Los Angeles Fire Department confirmed that firefighters arrived at the scene at approximately 3:30 p.m. PT and found the two adults already deceased. The victims, aged 78 and 68, were among the city’s most recognised cultural figures, prompting an outpouring of grief from Hollywood, political leaders and law‑enforcement officials.

Hollywood’s response was immediate and personal. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a long‑time donor to the arts, described the loss as “devastating,” praising Reiner’s creativity and Michele’s indispensable partnership. Neighbour and comedian Billy Crystal arrived at the house shortly after the call and was visibly shaken, “looked like he was about to cry,” while fellow comedian Larry David also stopped by, underscoring the closeness of the Reiner circle. The Lear family, close friends of the couple, issued a statement that the world is “unmistakably darker tonight,” reflecting the depth of personal loss felt within the industry.

Political figures joined the chorus of condolence. Governor Gavin Newsom released a press statement calling the Reiners “two of California’s most beloved cultural icons” and expressing his heartbreak. Several members of Congress posted statements of sympathy on social media, though their exact wording was not disclosed in the reports.

Law‑enforcement officials provided only procedural details. Margaret Stewart, spokesperson for the LAFD, reiterated the timeline of the emergency response, while senior leadership of the LAPD’s Robbery‑Homicide Division confirmed that a family member is being interviewed and that there is currently no evidence of forced entry. Neither the police nor city officials called for heightened personal security for celebrities or for revisions to homicide‑investigation protocols.

The Reiner case stands out when compared with other high‑profile Los Angeles homicides of the past five years. In 2022, UCLA student Brianna Kupfer was stabbed to death in Westwood, a neighbourhood similarly regarded as safe. The 2023 Monterey Park mass shooting, a firearm‑based attack, claimed twelve lives at a dance studio, highlighting the city’s ongoing struggle with gun violence. Earlier in July 2025, an “American Idol” executive was found dead in Encino after a 911 call from the victim’s home, an incident still under investigation. All three cases, like the Reiner murders, occurred in affluent districts—Brentwood, Westwood, Encino—underscoring that violent crime can penetrate even the city’s most secure neighbourhoods.

Statistically, the Reiner homicide is an outlier. Los Angeles homicide counts have been on a downward trajectory: from a pandemic‑era peak of 402 in 2021 to 329 in 2023 and 282 in 2024, with early‑2025 data indicating a further 10 % decline. Moreover, the victims’ ages—78 and 68—are well above the city’s median homicide victim age of roughly 35, and the use of a knife aligns the case with the minority of non‑shooting homicides, which accounted for about 30 % of total killings in 2024. The proximity of the Reiner residence to the 1994 Nicole Brown Simpson murder site has been noted, though no direct link has emerged.

In sum, the tragic deaths of Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner have reverberated across Hollywood, politics and law‑enforcement circles, while also highlighting a broader pattern of isolated, high‑profile violent incidents in otherwise low‑crime neighbourhoods. The investigation remains active, and the city watches closely for any developments that might illuminate motive or prevent future tragedies.
