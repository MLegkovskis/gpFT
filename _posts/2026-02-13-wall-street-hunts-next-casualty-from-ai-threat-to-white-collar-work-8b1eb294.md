# AI Threat to White-Collar Jobs
The increasing use of AI in various sectors is expected to lead to significant job displacement in white-collar jobs. According to recent reports, financial advisory firms, large investment banks, enterprise software SaaS providers, office real estate REITs, logistics carriers, and professional services consultancies are among the most exposed to AI-driven white-collar job loss.
## Affected Sectors and Companies
Several sectors and companies have already shown vulnerability to AI-driven job displacement. These include:
* Wealth management and financial advisory: Charles Schwab, Raymond James, Ameriprise, and Altruist Corp.
* Investment banking and large-cap banks: JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs
* Enterprise software/SaaS platforms: Monday.com, Atlassian, and ServiceNow
* Commercial real estate (office) REITs: Boston Properties, Kilroy Realty, and Vornado
* Transportation and logistics: C.H. Robinson, RXO, and J.B. Hunt
* Consulting and legal services: McKinsey & Company, Deloitte, and LegalZoom
## Market Reaction
The market has reacted negatively to AI-related announcements, with stock prices declining significantly. For example, Schwab's stock fell approximately 4% after Altruist launched an AI-powered tax-planning tool, while Monday.com's share price dropped around 20% after an AI-powered clone was demonstrated.
## Economic Implications
The increasing use of AI in white-collar jobs is expected to have significant economic implications. According to Goldman Sachs, 6-7% of the US white-collar workforce could be displaced by AI. Additionally, a survey of 150 Fortune 500 firms found that AI tools can boost productivity by 30-50%.
## Conclusion
The threat of AI-driven job displacement in white-collar jobs is real and significant. As AI technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see further job displacement and market disruption.
