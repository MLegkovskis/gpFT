**Wall Street traders are bracing for a bonus season that could leave many of them worse off than in recent years, as trading revenues dip and firms tighten compensation amid regulatory and AI‑driven cost pressures.**  

## Trading revenue under pressure  

U.S. commercial banks and savings associations reported **$15.0 billion** in trading revenue for the first quarter of 2025, a **2.7 % decline** from the previous quarter and **1.9 % lower** than a year earlier, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The drop was driven by weaker foreign‑exchange, equity and credit‑trading desks, offset only partially by a 56 % surge in holding‑company trading revenue from interest‑rate instruments.  

## Bonus pool expands, but the gains are uneven  

Compensation consultancy Johnson Associates now projects the overall Wall Street bonus pool to be the **largest since 2021**, with total compensation expenses up **almost 10 %** in the first half of 2025. The average annual bonus for bankers hit **$244,700** in 2024, a record level, and the consultancy expects a further rise of **8 %** across the sector this year.  

However, the uplift is not uniform. Johnson’s forecast gives **equity sales‑and‑trading bonuses a 15‑25 % increase**, while **fixed‑income desks are slated for 5‑15 % growth**. By contrast, Bloomberg’s December 1 report flags **lower bonuses for corporate‑debt traders**, citing a slowdown in high‑yield issuance and tighter risk‑adjusted returns.  

## Headwinds from regulation and automation  

Regulatory scrutiny has risen sharply since the 2023 “Basel III” revisions, prompting banks to allocate more capital to compliance and less to discretionary pay. Simultaneously, AI‑driven workflow automation is prompting a **10‑15 % reduction in headcount** on several trading floors, according to Reuters. The same outlet notes that base‑salary growth is expected to stall at **3‑3.5 %**, reinforcing the view that bonus pools will bear the brunt of cost‑containment measures.  

## What traders can expect  

- **Equity traders**: Likely to see modest upside, but still below the 2021 peak where bonuses exceeded $300,000.  
- **Fixed‑income and corporate‑debt desks**: Anticipate flat‑to‑slight increases, with some senior traders possibly facing cuts if desk profitability remains subdued.  
- **Junior traders and analysts**: May experience the sharpest squeeze, as firms prioritise senior talent in a tighter market.  

## Outlook  

If the first‑quarter revenue trend persists, the bonus season could mark a **relative decline for many traders**, even as the aggregate pool swells. The divergence underscores a broader shift on Wall Street: profitability is increasingly concentrated in a few high‑margin activities, while traditional trading desks grapple with lower margins, heightened compliance costs and the displacement effects of automation. Traders who can adapt to AI‑enhanced workflows or pivot to more lucrative product lines will be best positioned to protect their compensation in an otherwise challenging bonus cycle.
