**Bonus season on Wall Street may leave many traders disappointed again, even as overall payouts climb** – Compensation consultants Johnson Associates and Reuters report that the industry‑wide bonus pool is set to reach its highest level since 2021, yet equity‑sales and trading desks are likely to see modest increases of 15 %‑25 % while other units enjoy double‑digit hikes, leaving a gap between the most‑rewarded segments and the broader trading workforce.

## Market backdrop and profit figures  
The 130 NYSE‑listed banks posted a combined profit of **$30.4 billion in the first half of 2025**, on track to break the all‑time record if the pace holds (Investment News, 5 Nov 2025). Compensation expense rose **9.8 % year‑on‑year**, signalling a larger pool from which bonuses will be drawn. The average annual bonus for senior staff hit **$244,700 in 2024**, the highest level in a decade (Reuters, 5 Nov 2025).

## Bonus forecasts by business line  
- **Equity sales & trading:** projected uplift **15 %‑25 %** (Reuters).  
- **Fixed‑income sales & trading:** **5 %‑15 %** increase (Johnson Associates).  
- **M&A advisory & equity underwriting:** **10 %‑15 %** rise (Reuters).  
- **Asset management:** **7 %‑12 %** (AI‑CIO).  
- **Hedge funds, private credit, insurance, retail & commercial banking:** **5 %‑10 %** (AI‑CIO).  

By contrast, salary growth across the sector is expected to slow to **3 %‑3.5 %**, reflecting firms’ focus on cost control and the impact of AI‑driven headcount reductions (Reuters).

## Why traders could still lose out  
1. **Volatility‑driven pay:** Traders’ bonuses remain tightly linked to market turbulence. With the VIX hovering near 15‑18, lower realised volatility than in 2022‑23 reduces the upside for desk‑level staff.  
2. **Flat‑rate pool allocation:** Although the total pool expands, a larger share is earmarked for senior bankers and wealth‑management leaders, compressing the share available to mid‑tier traders.  
3. **AI and automation:** Firms are accelerating the deployment of algorithmic execution tools, cutting the number of human traders needed on desks. Johnson Associates notes that “AI‑enabled headcount reductions are already affecting bonus expectations for junior and mid‑level sales‑trading staff.”  

## Outlook for 2026  
If the global economy slows and credit conditions tighten, the bonus pool could contract, echoing the 14 % shrinkage forecast made in early 2024. Salary increments are likely to remain modest, and the competitive pressure for AI talent will intensify, further marginalising traditional trading roles.

## Bottom line  
While Wall Street’s overall bonus season looks healthier than the low‑point years of 2022‑23, the distribution of that upside is uneven. Traders, especially those not positioned in the highest‑earning equity‑sales desks, face the prospect of **smaller relative gains** or even flat bonuses, underscoring the sector’s lingering structural headwinds.
