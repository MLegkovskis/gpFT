**South Korean business & finance**

**South Korea’s economy is powering ahead with a 4.1 % YoY GDP surge in Q3 2025, yet a weakening won and volatile equity markets have forced the Bank of Korea and the Ministry of Economy & Finance into a cautious, reform‑driven policy stance.** The twin pressures of currency depreciation and elevated bond yields are testing the resilience of a growth model that has, until now, been buoyed by strong export performance and record corporate investment.

The latest national statistics show GDP expanding by 4.1 % year‑on‑year – the fastest pace in more than a year – while exports rose 6 % on the back of semiconductors and automobiles【CNBC】. Despite this macro‑strength, the won slipped to a fresh eight‑month low of 1,380 per dollar in early December, prompting an “emergency inter‑agency meeting” convened by Finance Minister Koo Yun‑cheol to address “rapid depreciation” and foreign‑exchange turbulence【NST】. The same week, the Bank of Korea’s Governor Rhee Chang‑yong described market volatility as “unusual” and signalled that the policy rate would remain at 3.50 % until inflation steadies around the 2 % target【Reuters‑BOK】.

In parallel with monetary caution, the finance ministry announced a structural reform: the “bank‑commerce separation” rules will be relaxed, allowing banks to own up to 30 % of non‑financial subsidiaries, up from the current 15 %【Reuters‑Bank】. This move aims to unlock private‑sector capital for strategic projects, complementing the Financial Services Commission’s launch of a ₩30 trillion National Growth Fund to back AI, green energy and biotech initiatives【FSC】.

Corporate giants have responded with hefty domestic spending. Samsung Electronics pledged ₩12 trillion (≈ $9.5 bn) for new R&D and production, while SK On announced a ₩5 trillion battery‑cell expansion, together amounting to roughly ₩17 trillion of fresh investment【Euronews】. Such commitments are intended to offset export‑headwinds and capitalise on anticipated regulatory easing.

Investor sentiment, however, remains fragile. The KOSPI fell 4.2 % in the week to 9 December – its steepest slide since July 2024 – as high‑growth tech stocks faced valuation concerns, with Samsung’s price‑to‑earnings ratio hovering around 22×【Reuters‑KOSPI】. Treasury‑bond yields rose to 3.85 % on the 10‑year curve, while foreign‑direct investment inflows reached US$13.2 bn, underscoring a mixed picture of capital inflows and rising financing costs【MOEF】.

A nascent but volatile segment is the stable‑coin market. Shares of Kakao Pay surged 38 % and ME2ON jumped 45 % after the government hinted at a regulatory sandbox for stable‑coins, illustrating how policy uncertainty can fuel speculative rallies【AInvest】.

Overall, South Korea’s macro fundamentals remain solid, but the confluence of a depreciating currency, higher bond yields and equity market corrections has prompted a dual‑track response: steady monetary policy to anchor inflation, and proactive fiscal reforms to stimulate private‑sector investment. The coming months will test whether these measures can sustain growth without igniting further market turbulence.
