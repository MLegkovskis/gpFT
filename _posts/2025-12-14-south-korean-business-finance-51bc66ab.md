**South Korean business & finance: FX pressure, modest growth and a cautious outlook** 

South Korea’s won slipped to a seven‑month low of roughly 1,460 KRW per dollar in early December, prompting Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang‑yong to blame “retail investors’ appetite for overseas equities” for the currency strain. The central bank, which has kept its policy rate steady at 3.50 %, warned that the surge in retail‑driven FX demand limits any further easing and underscored tighter coordination with the government to safeguard price stability. At the same time, the economy posted a 1.2 % quarter‑on‑quarter expansion in Q3 2025 – the fastest pace in 18 months – lifting year‑on‑year growth to 1.7 %, but full‑year forecasts remain under 1 %, reflecting a fragile recovery.

The BoK’s stance is shaped by a mix of external and domestic pressures. A Bloomberg report on 8 Dec highlighted a US$4 bn net outflow from Korean equities in November, the second‑largest monthly sell‑off on record, as foreign investors adopt a “cautious” posture amid global risk‑off sentiment and uncertainty over FX policy. Domestically, the governor reiterated on 9 Dec that the central bank will work closely with Prime Minister Kim Min‑seok to ensure exchange‑rate volatility does not undermine inflation targets. The Financial Services Commission, meanwhile, warned of “excessive” FX intervention and pledged a review of retail‑investor protection measures.

Growth prospects are being buoyed by a rebound in high‑tech exports. Export volumes rose 7.4 % YoY in Q3, driven by semiconductors, petrochemicals and automotive parts, which helped lift industrial production by 3.1 % YoY in August. Yet the early‑year contraction, caused by a slowdown in global demand and tighter U.S. monetary policy, left the economy hovering near stagnation. Fiscal stimulus – temporary tax cuts and increased public‑sector hiring – has modestly supported private consumption, but lingering supply‑chain bottlenecks in chip‑fab capacity and higher raw‑material costs cap upside potential.

The BoK’s macro‑forecast released in late November signalled a modestly more optimistic outlook, raising real GDP growth projections to 1.8 % for 2026 and 1.9 % for 2027, and hinting at a possible rate hike later in 2026. Governor Rhee also flagged U.S.–Korea trade tensions over new semiconductor tariffs as “bad for everybody”, pledging close monitoring of any spill‑over to inflation and growth.

Fintech firms such as Kakao Pay and Toss welcomed the central bank’s digital‑currency pilot, describing the “CBDC‑for‑subsidy” concept as a win‑win for financial inclusion and a way to lower transaction costs for low‑income households. Their optimism contrasts with the broader market’s wariness, underscoring a split between innovation‑driven optimism and macro‑level uncertainty.

Compared with the 1997 Asian financial crisis, today’s challenges are markedly different in scale and origin. The current episode revolves around retail‑driven FX pressure, modest export‑led growth and policy coordination, whereas the 1997 crisis was characterised by a sudden, massive devaluation of the won, a systemic banking collapse and a sovereign debt scramble. The present environment, while volatile, does not exhibit the same depth of financial distress, but the BoK’s emphasis on coordination and oversight reflects a determination to avoid a repeat of past turmoil.

In sum, South Korea’s business and finance landscape in mid‑December 2025 is defined by a weakened won, cautious foreign capital, a central bank balancing rate stability with FX volatility, and a modestly improving export sector. The government’s proactive stance on coordination and fintech innovation aims to cushion the economy, but the underlying fragility means that any escalation in trade tensions or further FX swings could quickly erode the tentative gains.
