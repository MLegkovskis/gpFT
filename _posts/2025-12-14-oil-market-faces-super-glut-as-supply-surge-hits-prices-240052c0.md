# Oil market faces ‘super glut’ as supply surge hits prices 

**The International Energy Agency now estimates a global oil surplus of roughly 1.9 million barrels per day – the largest sustained excess in a decade – and analysts observe Brent crude confined to a low‑$60s price corridor despite the glut.** The surplus, measured over the January‑September 2025 period, is compounded by more than 1.4 billion barrels of crude idle at sea, a stockpile that translates to an additional 1.5 million barrels per day of excess capacity when averaged over a typical month. Together, these imbalances have eroded the upward momentum that lifted Brent above $70 per barrel in 2023‑2024, anchoring the benchmark between $61 and $66 per barrel for the past two months. 

The price pressure is evident across the Atlantic as well. North Sea Dated, the primary Brent proxy, has settled around $63 a barrel, while U.S. WTI hovers near $59. Yet the decline is modest rather than catastrophic. Market observers attribute the relative resilience to a combination of strategic storage draws – notably China’s recent release from its strategic reserves – and the persistence of geopolitical risk premiums that continue to underpin demand‑side sentiment. 

The “super‑glut” narrative is reinforced by the scale of idle cargoes. Click Petroleo e Gás reported that more than 1.4 billion barrels of crude sit idle on tankers, a figure that, when spread across a 30‑day cycle, adds roughly 1.5 million barrels per day of latent supply to the market. This hidden capacity, layered on top of the 1.9 million‑barrel‑per‑day surplus identified by the IEA, creates a buffer that can be rapidly mobilised should producers decide to increase lift rates or if logistical bottlenecks ease. 

Despite the abundant supply, OPEC+ has struggled to restore price stability. The alliance, which has spent the better part of two years defending a $70‑$75 price band, now faces a dilemma: further production cuts could risk a supply shock if demand falters, while maintaining current output risks cementing the low‑$60s as the new norm. The market’s response to the surplus has been a modest easing rather than a sharp collapse, suggesting that storage capacity and risk‑adjusted demand are still absorbing a significant portion of the excess. 

Analysts warn that the current equilibrium is fragile. Any resurgence of geopolitical tension – for example, renewed sanctions on Russian oil or instability in the Middle East – could quickly lift risk premiums and buoy prices. Conversely, a sustained draw‑down of strategic reserves or a further increase in non‑OPEC production, particularly from U.S. shale, could deepen the glut and push Brent below $60. 

In the short term, the most likely scenario is a continuation of the low‑$60s corridor, with Brent oscillating between $61 and $66 as market participants balance the twin forces of abundant supply and lingering demand uncertainty. The coming months will test whether the “super‑glut” is a temporary overshoot that can be absorbed by existing storage and demand buffers, or whether it heralds a more prolonged period of subdued oil prices that could reshape investment decisions across the energy sector.
