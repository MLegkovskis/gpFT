**Oil market faces a “super‑glut” as supply surge drags Brent below $70 a barrel** – OPEC+ has chosen a “strategic pause” on output hikes rather than fresh cuts, while Saudi Arabia warns that prolonged sub‑$70 prices will strain its fiscal balance. The result is a global surplus of roughly 1.9 million barrels per day (mb/d) in the January‑September 2025 period – almost double the overhang recorded a year earlier – and a looming risk of Brent slipping beneath $60/bbl if the glut deepens【<https://www.iea.org/commentaries/as-oil-market-surplus-keeps-rising-something-s-got-to-give】.>

The cartel’s response is deliberately cautious. OPEC+ has halted any further quota increases for the first quarter of 2026 and is allowing the unwind of the 2.2 m bpd voluntary adjustments that began on 1 April 2025 to run its course. Eight members added 411 000 bpd to their quotas in April 2025, meaning that up to 2.2 m bpd of extra OPEC crude could re‑enter the market by September 2025 if the schedule proceeds as planned【<https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/business/opec-plus-oil.html】.> The OPEC Secretariat frames the price fall as partly intentional – a bid to “price out” competing energy sources – but acknowledges the danger of a protracted oversupply that could erode member revenues【<https://mepc.org/commentaries/making-sense-opecs-reasons-lowering-oil-prices/】.>

Saudi Arabia, the swing producer, publicly defends a price floor of $70‑$75 per barrel, warning that sustained sub‑$70 levels would jeopardise its budget. Yet it has not announced an immediate unilateral cut, instead urging the OPEC+ group to keep the floor intact while retaining “full flexibility” to act if the market deteriorates further【<https://kpmg.com/au/en/insights/economics-geopolitics/geopolitical-implications-of-the-opec-oil-production-cut.html】.> The kingdom’s parallel $500 bn Neom diversification programme underscores its desire to reduce fiscal reliance on oil amid the glut.

The surplus is being fed not only by OPEC+ unwind but also by a wave of new non‑OPEC projects. Brazil’s pre‑Santos offshore fields, Guyana’s Liza Phase 2, and continued U.S. light‑oil drilling together add roughly 1.4 m bpd in 2025, while U.S., Canadian and Brazilian output is set to rise another 1.6 m bpd【<https://www.iea.org/commentaries/as-oil-market-surplus-keeps-rising-something-s-got-to-give】.> Demand growth, by contrast, is modest – about 0.7 m bpd per year – leaving a widening gap that has already pushed visible global crude stocks up by 2 m bpd in the past month, according to Goldman analyst Daan Struyven【<https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Trafigura-Warns-of-Super-Glut-as-Oil-Supply-Surges.html】.>

The “super‑glut” bears a striking resemblance to the 2014‑16 oil‑price collapse. Both episodes involve an excess of 2‑3 m bpd and a price plunge of more than 70 % – Brent fell from $112/bbl in June 2014 to $31/bbl in January 2016【ScienceDirect】. However, the current oversupply is driven by a new cohort of offshore projects and a post‑pandemic demand slowdown, whereas the earlier shock was sparked by a rapid U.S. shale surge and a sudden global growth slowdown. Moreover, the present glut is unfolding over a longer horizon (2024‑26) and is being managed through a “pause” rather than the outright refusal to cut that characterised OPEC’s 2014 stance【ScienceDirect】.

If Brent breaches the $60‑$65/bbl band, OPEC+ has pledged “full flexibility” to re‑impose cuts, but for now the cartel prefers to manage the pace of supply rather than trigger a fresh wave of production reductions. The market will be watching closely whether Saudi Arabia steps in to defend its price floor, or whether the surplus widens to the projected 4 mb/d level anticipated for 2026【<https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPECs-Strategic-Pause-Signals-a-Shifting-Oil-Power-Balance.html】.>
