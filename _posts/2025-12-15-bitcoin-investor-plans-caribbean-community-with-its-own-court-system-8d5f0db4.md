**Bitcoin‑backed One Bequia aims to create a self‑governing enclave on a tiny Grenadine island, promising a $150 million injection, 39 luxury villas and, unusually, its own private court system.** The development, announced in October 2024, seeks to position the 18‑square‑kilometre island of Bequia as the Caribbean’s first residential community where Bitcoin is the sole medium of payment and dispute resolution is handled internally, separate from the courts of St Vincent & the Grenadines.

The consortium behind One Bequia, a group of crypto‑enthusiasts and property developers, plans to break ground on the first phase in the second quarter of 2025, with completion slated for 2027. The venture is marketed as a “self‑governing community” that will leverage blockchain to bypass legacy financial services, promote financial inclusion and attract high‑net‑worth digital‑asset holders. By limiting the residential footprint to 39 villas, the project is expected to host roughly 150‑200 residents, creating a tightly controlled micro‑economy centred on cryptocurrency transactions.

One Bequia’s ambition to operate a private judicial body sets it apart from other Caribbean attempts at economic autonomy. The Cayman Islands’ Cayman Enterprise City (CEC) – a series of special economic zones created under legislation passed in 2011‑2012 – offers 100 % tax exemption and streamlined licensing to knowledge‑based firms, but all legal disputes remain under the jurisdiction of the Cayman courts, overseen by the government‑appointed Special Economic Zone Authority. Since its launch, CEC has attracted over 250 companies, now housing around 275 firms and generating roughly $1 billion of annual economic activity, a scale far beyond the modest residential enclave envisioned for Bequia.

Bermuda’s Economic Empowerment Zones (EEZs) present another regional model. Established between 2007 and 2011, the three land‑based zones – Northeast Hamilton, Somerset and St George’s – focus on community regeneration, offering targeted grants and infrastructure upgrades without any separate judicial framework. The islands also maintain a maritime Exclusive Economic Zone extending 200 nautical miles, but, like the Cayman model, all legal matters are adjudicated within the national court system. The EEZs aim to add about $200 million to the economy over a decade, primarily through SME growth.

In terms of scale, One Bequia is the smallest of the three initiatives, covering a single island of 18 km² and housing a handful of households. Its projected $150 million investment is modest compared with the multi‑billion‑dollar footprint of the Cayman SEZs, yet its novelty lies in the legal autonomy it seeks. By establishing a private court, the developers intend to provide rapid, blockchain‑enabled dispute resolution, a feature that could appeal to crypto‑savvy investors wary of conventional legal delays. However, the absence of any public statements from local government officials or regional business leaders in the available material leaves the broader implications for the national judiciary and regulatory oversight uncertain.

The experimental nature of One Bequia raises questions about jurisdiction, enforcement and the interaction between a private adjudicative body and the sovereign legal framework of St Vincent & the Grenadines. While the project promises to diversify the island’s economy and position it at the forefront of digital‑asset tourism, its success will hinge on navigating the delicate balance between innovative self‑governance and the rule of law upheld by the host nation.

If One Bequia proves viable, it could herald a new class of crypto‑centric enclaves in the Caribbean, offering a template for private governance that blends blockchain technology with real‑world property development. Conversely, any friction with national authorities could serve as a cautionary tale for future ventures seeking to carve out legal islands in the region’s existing judicial seas.
