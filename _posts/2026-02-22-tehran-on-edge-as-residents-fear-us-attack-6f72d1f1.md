# Tehran on Edge as Residents Fear US Attack
The current diplomatic relations between the US and Iran are strained, with formal ties severed since 1980. The US has a comprehensive sanctions regime in place, and there have been recent military deployments to the region, including the USS Gerald R. Ford to the Gulf of Oman. 
## Recent Escalation Triggers
* June 2025: US and Israeli airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear sites
* February 2026: Deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford and four destroyers to the Strait of Hormuz
* February 2026: US leadership ultimatum, with a 10-day deadline for Iran to reach a deal
## International Organizations and Countries' Roles
* The UN has convened emergency Security Council meetings and passed resolutions calling for de-escalation and restraint.
* The EU has issued joint declarations and statements urging the US and Iran to return to diplomatic channels.
* Regional powers such as Iraq, Oman, and Qatar have offered to host talks and facilitate dialogue between the US and Iran.
