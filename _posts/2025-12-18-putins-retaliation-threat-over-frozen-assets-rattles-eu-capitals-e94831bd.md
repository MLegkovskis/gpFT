**Putin’s retaliation threat over frozen assets rattles EU capitals**

The European Union has immobilised roughly **€210 billion** of Russian sovereign assets, the bulk of which sits in the Belgian clearing house Euroclear. At an estimated $247 billion, the frozen pool represents about **12‑13 % of Russia’s $1.69 trillion nominal GDP** in 2023. Analysts agree that the loss of access will shave **0.5 percentage points** from Russia’s 2023 growth and impose a **cumulative 1‑2 % drag on real GDP** through 2026. The International Monetary Fund adds that the same €210 billion buffer could depress the 2025 growth forecast by another **0.3‑0.5 percentage points**. 

President Vladimir Putin, speaking on 10 December 2025, warned that the freeze “undermines our financial stability and could cost the Russian economy billions.” Within days, the Kremlin’s foreign‑ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova declared that “any freezing or confiscation of Russia’s sovereign assets constitutes illegal disposal without Moscow’s consent” and pledged “swift retaliatory measures.” The Bank of Russia has already lodged a lawsuit against Euroclear in Moscow’s Arbitration Court, signalling a legal‑economic package aimed at blocking the EU’s plan to tap the frozen pool for a **€140 billion “reparations loan”** to Ukraine. 

The current threat marks a qualitative escalation from previous Russian counter‑sanctions. In August 2014, Moscow responded to the EU’s first sanctions with **Presidential Decree No 300**, banning imports of EU food products worth roughly **$2 billion**. After the 2022 “Package 23” sanctions, **Decree No 473** suspended a range of EU‑origin goods, affecting about **€5 bn** of trade. A 2024 amendment to the *Arbitrazh Procedure Code* gave Russian courts exclusive jurisdiction over disputes involving foreign‑seized assets, a legal shield rather than a direct financial strike. Later, targeted bans on EU luxury goods (≈ €200 m) and threats to seize EU‑owned energy assets (≈ €10 bn) kept the scale of retaliation in the single‑digit‑billion‑euro range. 

By contrast, the 2025 stance confronts the **€300 billion** sovereign‑asset pool itself, threatening to block a **€140 bn** loan that the EU hopes to use to fund Ukraine’s reconstruction. The rhetoric has also hardened: Putin’s team labels the EU move “theft” and “illegal disposal,” while Zakharova promises “not delayed” retaliation. Earlier counter‑measures were framed as defensive, invoking domestic decrees and sector‑specific bans; the present approach invokes **international law**, positioning the EU’s action as a breach of sovereign‑property rights and backing it with a high‑profile court case. 

The economic calculus for Moscow is clear. With frozen reserves equivalent to a tenth of its GDP, Russia faces a tangible drag on growth, while the EU risks a new front in its sanctions campaign that could destabilise financial markets if Euroclear’s operations are disrupted. The legal battle over asset ownership may also set a precedent for how sovereign‑asset freezes are contested in international courts, potentially reshaping the sanctions‑retaliation playbook for both sides. 

If the EU proceeds with using the frozen assets, Moscow’s “reciprocal measures” could include further bans on EU imports, targeted seizures of EU‑owned infrastructure, or coordinated legal challenges that delay or block the flow of funds to Kyiv. The stakes extend beyond the immediate fiscal impact; they touch on the credibility of the EU’s sanctions regime and the resilience of the continent’s financial architecture. 

In sum, the immobilisation of €210 billion has become a flashpoint that intertwines macro‑economic pressure with a heightened legal and rhetorical confrontation. The coming weeks will test whether the EU can sustain its financing strategy for Ukraine without triggering a broader economic backlash from a Russia that now wields its frozen sovereign assets as a bargaining chip on the global stage.
