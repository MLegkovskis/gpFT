**EU internal trade is slipping again, with intra‑EU transactions falling 2.5 % in 2024 and the trade‑to‑GDP ratio dropping to 95.7 % in 2023 – a 7.9 % decline from the previous year. The slowdown sits between the modest contraction of the 2008 financial crisis and the sharp collapse of the 2020 COVID‑19 pandemic, signalling a persistent, if not yet acute, deceleration in the bloc’s economic integration.** 

The latest Eurostat figures show that the total value of intra‑EU trade slipped by 2.5 % year‑on‑year in 2024, with exports down 1.2 % and imports following a similar trajectory. The trade‑to‑GDP ratio, which combines goods and services, fell from a peak of 103.6 % in 2022 to 95.69 % in 2023. The first quarter after the end of the Brexit transition period recorded a dramatic 23.1 % fall in EU‑UK trade, underscoring the broader fragility of cross‑border flows. 

By contrast, the 2008‑2009 financial crisis produced a milder but still noticeable contraction. Intra‑EU exports fell 5.2 % and imports 4.8 % in 2008, while the Trade‑Intensity Index dropped from 0.78 to 0.71 in 2009 – a 9 % reduction relative to the pre‑crisis level. Recovery was relatively swift: intra‑EU trade returned to modest growth by 2021, buoyed by the easing of credit constraints and a rebound in consumer demand. 

The pandemic’s impact was far more severe. The trade‑to‑GDP ratio plunged to 83.69 % in 2020, a 6.74 % fall from 2019, while intra‑EU trade volumes slumped 12.3 % year‑on‑year. Exports and imports each fell by roughly 11‑13 %, the sharpest decline since the 2009 downturn. A rapid rebound followed in 2021‑22, lifting the trade‑to‑GDP ratio to a new high of 25.3 % of GDP in 2022 before easing back to 22.4 % in 2023. 

The current slowdown differs from both precedents in several respects. Its depth is modest compared with the pandemic shock but exceeds the post‑2008 rebound, suggesting a more structural drag rather than a temporary disruption. The trade‑to‑GDP ratio has recovered from its 2020 trough yet remains below the pre‑crisis level of 2008, indicating that the EU’s internal market has not fully reclaimed its former dynamism. Moreover, the persistent negative trend in intra‑EU exports – down 1.2 % in 2024 – and the sharp post‑Brexit dip point to lingering frictions that could harden into longer‑term constraints. 

Underlying drivers are a mix of macro‑economic and geopolitical factors. High inflation and volatile energy prices continue to squeeze purchasing power, while lingering supply‑chain bottlenecks limit the flow of intermediate goods. The conclusion of the Brexit transition has removed a temporary facilitation mechanism, exposing the EU to new customs and regulatory hurdles. Unlike the credit crunch of 2008 or the lockdowns of 2020, today’s slowdown is shaped by a combination of cost pressures, policy uncertainty, and a re‑calibration of trade patterns across the continent. 

Policymakers face a delicate balancing act. While the data do not yet signal an imminent crisis, the trend warrants close monitoring to prevent a slide into a prolonged stagnation of intra‑EU commerce. Targeted measures to ease customs procedures, bolster energy security, and support sectors most exposed to price volatility could help stabilise the trade‑to‑GDP ratio and restore confidence in the single market’s integrative role.
