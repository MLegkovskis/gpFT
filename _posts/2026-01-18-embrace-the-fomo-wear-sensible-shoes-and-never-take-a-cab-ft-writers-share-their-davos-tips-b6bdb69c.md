**The World Economic Forum’s Davos summit has morphed from a modest European management symposium into a global megaconference, yet its core credo—multistakeholder dialogue for the common good—remains unchanged. Over five decades the gathering has expanded in size, scope and influence, absorbing seismic geopolitical and economic shocks while adding climate, technology and security to its agenda. Today, practical tips such as “wear sensible shoes and never take a cab” sit alongside high‑level policy debates, reflecting a culture that blends elite networking with grounded pragmatism.**

When Klaus Schwab convened the first European Management Symposium in January 1971, he imagined a modest assembly of roughly 450 CEOs, academics and policymakers from 31 countries. His opening words stressed “lasting progress requires cooperation between business, government and civil society” and enshrined stakeholder capitalism as the guiding principle: firms should serve employees, suppliers and communities, not merely shareholders. The early format was a two‑week ski‑resort talk‑shop, with the first political invitation arriving in 1974.

The modern Forum, now branded the World Economic Forum, operates from offices in Geneva, New York, Beijing, Tokyo, San Francisco and Mumbai. Its 2024 mission—“Improving the state of the world through public‑private cooperation in the spirit of global citizenship”—echoes Schwab’s original intent but adds explicit climate‑and‑technology pillars. Participant numbers have swelled to more than 2 000 leaders from over 100 nations, accompanied by a media pool that has grown from 450 journalists in 2014 to roughly 480 today. The agenda is organised around the Fourth Industrial Revolution, global commons such as climate change, and geopolitical‑security risks, with regional “Shaping the Future” meetings and a permanent Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco.

Continuity and change can be charted across several dimensions. The purpose of fostering stakeholder capitalism persists, yet the Forum now produces Davos Manifestos, ESG scorecards and policy‑influencing coalitions such as the “Great Reset” of 2020. Leadership composition has broadened from predominantly CEOs to a regular mix of 30‑40 heads of state, NGOs, youth leaders and media figures. While still lacking formal decision‑making authority, Davos now commands a hybrid presence—live‑streamed to over 30 million viewers—while retaining its Alpine setting and even health‑safety protocols that advise “sensible shoes” on snow‑covered walkways.

A succession of historic moments reshaped the Forum’s trajectory. The 1973 collapse of Bretton Woods and the Yom Kippur War pushed the agenda beyond pure management to macro‑economic and geopolitical concerns, culminating in the first Davos Manifesto. The 1979 invitation to the People’s Republic of China marked the shift to a truly global platform. In 1982 a Davos trade‑minister meeting sowed the seeds of the Uruguay Round, eventually birthing the WTO. The 1992 Mandela‑de Klerk dialogue cemented Davos as a stage for post‑apartheid reconciliation, while the 1994 Peres‑Arafat draft underscored its role in Middle‑East back‑channel diplomacy. The 2008 financial crisis spurred the 2009 “Great Reset” narrative, and the 2015 Paris Agreement brought climate policy to the fore. The COVID‑19 pandemic forced a fully virtual Davos in 2021, accelerating digital participation, and the Russia‑Ukraine war of 2022‑23 redirected focus to energy security and supply‑chain resilience.

Amid this evolution, the cultural tone of the meeting has softened. An FT insider tip from June 2024 advises delegates to “embrace the FOMO, wear sensible shoes and never take a cab,” noting that the most fruitful conversations now happen on the snow‑covered walkways rather than in chauffeured limousines. The advice captures a broader shift: Davos is no longer merely a gala for the elite but a pragmatic forum where health, sustainability and accessibility are part of the agenda.

In sum, Davos retains Schwab’s founding spirit of multistakeholder cooperation while having expanded into a global catalyst for policy, technology and climate action. Its history of adapting to world events—financial crises, pandemics, wars—demonstrates a resilience that ensures the summit remains a barometer of the challenges and opportunities shaping the twenty‑first‑century economy.
