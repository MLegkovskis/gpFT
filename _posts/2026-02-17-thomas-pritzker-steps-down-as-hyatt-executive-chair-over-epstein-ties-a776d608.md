# Hyatt Faces Financial Repercussions After Thomas Pritzker's Resignation
Hyatt Hotels Corp. is facing significant financial repercussions after Thomas Pritzker stepped down as executive chairman due to his association with Jeffrey Epstein. The company's stock price fell 4.2% on the day of the announcement, resulting in a loss of approximately $400 million in equity value.
## Potential Financial Repercussions
The potential financial repercussions for Hyatt include:
* Up to $500 million in legal exposure from Epstein-related claims
* A credit-rating downgrade, which could raise borrowing costs by approximately $10 million per year
* A loss of corporate-client bookings, with projected revenue losses of $150-$200 million over the next two quarters
* Insurance premium hikes, with estimated increases of 15-20%
* Brand-value erosion, with a potential write-down of $360 million
## Impact on Hyatt's Revenue and Measures to Mitigate Losses
The company's revenue may be impacted by the loss of corporate-client bookings and the potential brand-value erosion. To mitigate these losses, Hyatt may need to take measures such as restructuring its leadership, enhancing its corporate governance, and investing in reputation management.
