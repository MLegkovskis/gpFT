**Diamond‑based quantum devices have moved from laboratory curiosities to commercial products, with sensor kits from Lockheed Martin and Bosch shipped in early 2025 and a European supply chain delivering thousands of high‑purity diamond wafers each year. The rapid escalation of research groups, industry partnerships and performance metrics marks a turning point that rivals the early milestones of quantum computing itself.** 

The past five years have seen a cascade of breakthroughs. In 2021 Delft University of Technology demonstrated the first large‑scale quantum‑repeater node using nitrogen‑vacancy (NV) centres, entangling photons over more than 10 km of fibre and proving that diamond can underpin a 100 % secure quantum internet. The following year the EU‑funded GroDiaQ project secured €30 million to mass‑produce 4‑inch diamond wafers, targeting output of over 10 000 wafers annually and laying the groundwork for chip‑scale quantum processors and sensors. 

UChicago’s “stretched‑diamond” qubits, reported in 2023‑24, operate at roughly 4 K with microwave power under 10 mW, slashing cryogenic overhead by about 80 %. Their coherence times of around 2 ms and gate fidelities exceeding 99.5 % on a two‑qubit prototype outstrip the 0.5 ms coherence typical of earlier NV devices. In 2024 German team NVision transferred NV electronic spin to nuclear spins of target molecules, delivering magnetic‑resonance imaging sensitivity a thousand times greater than conventional MRI and detecting sub‑10 pmol contrast agents. By the first quarter of 2025, commercial diamond‑quantum sensor kits were being deployed for field‑ready magnetic anomaly detection, offering a noise floor of 10 pT·Hz⁻¹ᐟ² across a temperature span of –50 °C to +80 °C. 

When measured against the historic arc of quantum‑computer development, the contrast is striking. Early quantum computers were proof‑of‑concept devices: a five‑qubit NMR processor in 2000, a seven‑qubit liquid‑state NMR implementation of Shor’s algorithm in 2001, and D‑Wave’s 128‑qubit annealer in 2011, all requiring millikelvin environments and delivering modest qubit counts. Diamond platforms today still host modest qubit numbers—typically two to four in prototype chips—but already achieve multi‑qubit entanglement, long‑coherence times and, crucially, operation at temperatures compatible with conventional cryogenic infrastructure. 

The ecosystem’s scale has expanded dramatically. While the early 2000s quantum‑computer community comprised a few dozen research groups, more than 200 academic teams were active in diamond quantum research by 2021, joined by heavyweight industrial players such as Lockheed Martin, Bosch, Thales and Quantum Diamond Technologies. This growth outpaces the early quantum‑computer era, where industry involvement was limited to IBM, Google, Intel and a handful of startups. 

Diamond’s versatility also widens the application horizon. Early quantum computers focused on algorithmic demonstrations—Shor’s factorisation, Grover’s search, quantum annealing—whereas diamond technology now spans secure networking, ultra‑sensitive magnetometry, and molecular‑level imaging. The convergence of a mature supply chain, CMOS‑compatible fabrication pathways and room‑temperature‑compatible sensors suggests a near‑term commercial niche that the first generation of quantum processors never achieved. 

Looking ahead, roadmaps from leading firms project diamond‑based processors with more than 50 NV‑linked qubits by 2027, while the established wafer production capacity promises seamless integration with existing semiconductor fabs. If the current trajectory holds, diamond‑powered quantum devices could become the workhorse of specialised quantum tasks, complementing rather than replacing superconducting and trapped‑ion platforms that dominate general‑purpose quantum computing. The quantum revolution, once defined by abstract theory and fragile prototypes, is now being forged in the hardest natural material on Earth.
