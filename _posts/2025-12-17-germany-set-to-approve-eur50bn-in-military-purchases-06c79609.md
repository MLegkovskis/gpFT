**Germany’s parliament is poised to approve a €50 billion procurement package that dwarfs any single‑year defence outlay since reunification, marking a decisive shift in Berlin’s military financing.** The plan, covering new aircraft, ships, missiles and ground systems, will be the largest procurement tranche ever recorded in the post‑Cold‑War era and will push total 2025 defence spending well above the NATO benchmark of 2 % of gross domestic product.

The €50 billion figure represents more than half of the €100 billion “Zeitenwende” special fund created in 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While the special fund is a multi‑year financing vehicle, the new package is the biggest single‑year procurement slice within it, effectively matching the entire regular defence budget of 2024, which stood at roughly €90 billion. By contrast, the highest annual nominal outlay before this surge was €38.7 billion in 2021, a level that had risen only modestly from €28.5 billion in 1991 – a 35.8 % increase over three decades.

When placed against Germany’s cumulative spending since 1991, the €50 billion tranche is striking. The total nominal defence expenditure from 1991 to 2021 amounted to €38.7 billion; a single year’s procurement now exceeds that cumulative sum by nearly 30 %. In 2020, before the Ukraine crisis, Germany’s defence budget was roughly €48 billion (US$52.8 billion), accounting for about 1.3 % of GDP. By 2024, regular spending had risen to €80 billion (US$88.5 billion), representing 2.1 % of GDP. Adding the €50 billion package would lift 2025 outlays to an estimated 2.7 % of GDP – a level not seen since the late Cold‑War period when West Germany hovered around 2.4 % of GDP.

The scale of the new procurement underscores Berlin’s determination to transform the Bundeswehr from a force constrained by decades of under‑investment into a modern, expeditionary capability. The package is expected to fund next‑generation fighter jets, advanced naval vessels and precision‑guided missile systems, addressing long‑standing capability gaps highlighted after Russia’s full‑scale invasion of Ukraine. Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has framed the move as essential for safeguarding Europe’s security architecture and for meeting Germany’s obligations under the NATO collective defence clause.

Strategically, the infusion of €50 billion will reinforce Germany’s role within the EU’s emerging defence initiatives and bolster the credibility of the alliance’s eastern flank. By committing resources that eclipse any single‑year spend since reunification, Berlin signals that it will no longer be a “free rider” in European security, but a principal contributor capable of sustaining high‑intensity operations. The decision also places pressure on other NATO members to match Germany’s fiscal resolve, potentially reshaping the alliance’s overall defence posture in the coming decade.

In sum, the forthcoming approval of the €50 billion procurement package marks a historic inflection point. It eclipses past annual budgets, rivals the size of the 2022 special fund, and propels Germany’s defence spending to a proportion of GDP that aligns with, and even exceeds, the alliance’s long‑standing target. The move is likely to reverberate across Europe, redefining both national and collective security strategies.
