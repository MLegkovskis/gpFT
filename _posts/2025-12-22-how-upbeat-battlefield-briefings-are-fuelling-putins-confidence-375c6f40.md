# How upbeat battlefield briefings are fuelling Putin’s confidence 

**President Vladimir Putin’s public pronouncements about the war in Ukraine have taken on an increasingly buoyant tone, even as Russia’s macro‑economic outlook grows ever more precarious. Forecasts for 2025 place real GDP growth at a modest 0.6 %–0.9 %, a sharp deceleration from the 1.2 % recorded the previous year and far below the 2 %–3 % expansion seen before the conflict began. At the same time, the share of national output devoted to defence has surged to unprecedented levels, with the state earmarking between 6.3 % and 7.5 % of GDP for military spending in 2025, and broader defence‑and‑security outlays edging toward 8 % of GDP. The juxtaposition of a stagnant economy and a rapidly expanding war‑budget underpins the optimism that Putin projects in his battlefield briefings, reinforcing a narrative of resilience that bolsters his domestic standing and signals resolve to foreign audiences.** 

The fiscal re‑orientation is stark. A September 2024 Reuters report noted a 23 % increase in the national defence line for 2025, lifting the budget share to 6.3 % of GDP – the highest proportion since the Cold War. The same period saw the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) project an even higher figure of 7.5 % of GDP, reflecting divergent methodologies but a clear consensus that defence spending is climbing sharply. SIPRI’s April 2025 estimate corroborates this trend, placing total military expenditure – including classified items – at 7.2 % of GDP, equivalent to 15.5 trillion roubles. 

A more granular picture emerges from an exclusive interview with Defence Minister Andrey Belousov published in December 2025. Belousov disclosed that 5.1 % of Russia’s entire GDP is being spent directly on the war, while the wider Defence Ministry budget consumes 7.3 % of GDP. The draft budget submitted to the State Duma in October 2025 pushes the proportion even higher, earmarking 38 % of all federal spending for defence and domestic security – a slice that translates to roughly 8 % of GDP. 

These figures illustrate a fiscal pivot: as growth stalls, the Kremlin is willing to allocate an ever‑larger slice of the national pie to sustain the war effort. The economic trade‑off is evident in the Russia‑Ukraine War Report Card released in December 2025, which projects growth of only 0.6 %–0.9 % for the year, underscoring the limited room for domestic investment outside the defence sphere. 

Against this backdrop, Putin’s upbeat briefings serve a dual purpose. Domestically, they mask the grim reality of a near‑flat economy, presenting the conflict as a source of national pride and a catalyst for industrial mobilisation. Internationally, the confident tone signals that Russia will continue to fund its military ambitions despite economic headwinds, a message that complicates diplomatic calculations and sustains a perception of strategic endurance. 

Analysts note that the growing proportion of GDP devoted to defence is unsustainable in the long term, yet the current fiscal commitment appears to be a calculated gamble: by foregrounding military successes – however modest – the Kremlin hopes to rally public support and deter external pressure. The “upbeat battlefield briefings” thus become a political instrument, translating fiscal muscle into psychological capital for the president. 

In sum, Russia’s economic data for 2025 reveal a nation grappling with stagnant growth while pouring an ever‑larger share of its resources into the war machine. The resulting confidence displayed in Putin’s briefings is less a reflection of economic vigor than a strategic narrative designed to sustain morale and project strength amid fiscal strain.
