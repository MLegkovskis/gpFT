**The United States has taken an unprecedented step in Venezuela, capturing President Nicolás Maduro and his wife in a January 2026 raid and announcing a temporary U.S. administration while publicly dismissing opposition leader María Corina Machado and courting Maduro’s vice‑president, Delcy Rodríguez. The move marks a stark departure from the 2019 strategy of recognising opposition figure Juan Guaidó, signalling a shift from diplomatic endorsement to direct military involvement and a willingness to work with a Maduro‑aligned official.** 

The raid on 3 January 2026, reported by USNI News, placed Maduro in U.S. custody and was immediately followed by a statement that the United States would “run Venezuela” pending the formation of a new government. In a 4 January interview with the *Palm Beach Post*, former President Donald Trump described Machado as “a very nice woman but she doesn’t have the respect … to lead the country,” while praising Rodríguez as “willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.” The administration framed the intervention as a temporary measure to restore order and protect oil interests, rather than a formal diplomatic recognition of any opposition figure. International reaction has been muted; no multilateral body such as the OAS or the EU has endorsed the unilateral action, and the statement remains isolated.

By contrast, the 2019 U.S. response to Venezuela’s crisis was built on a broad diplomatic coalition. On 23 January 2019, Trump announced the official recognition of Juan Guaidó, the president of the National Assembly, as interim head of state under Article 233 of the 1999 Constitution. Within weeks, nearly sixty countries, backed by an OAS resolution on 10 January, joined the recognition. The United States complemented the diplomatic move with a sanctions package that froze assets of senior Maduro officials and barred U.S. persons from dealing with Venezuelan oil exports, using executive orders 13808 and 13850. Despite the extensive support, Guaidó never exercised effective control, and by late 2022 the opposition’s institutional presence had largely dissolved, prompting a gradual easing of sanctions.

The two episodes differ on several key dimensions. In 2019, the United States employed a legal‑diplomatic instrument—formal recognition—supported by a sizable international coalition and a coordinated sanctions regime. The rhetoric centred on “restoring democracy” and the “will of the Venezuelan people.” In 2026, the approach is kinetic and unilateral: a military capture, a statement of temporary administration, and an overture to a Maduro‑aligned official, with rhetoric focused on “making Venezuela great again,” “stability,” and “protecting oil interests.” No new sanctions have been announced, and the lack of multilateral backing has drawn criticism for resembling a regime‑change operation.

The bottom‑line assessment is that the United States has pivoted from a strategy of diplomatic endorsement of opposition to a direct, force‑based intervention that sidesteps the opposition’s leading figure. The scale of international support has collapsed from a coalition of roughly sixty states to a solitary unilateral action. Tools have shifted from economic pressure to kinetic force and political overtures to regime insiders. As Maduro remains in U.S. custody and Rodríguez is being courted, the political future of Venezuela hangs in the balance, with the United States now positioned as the de‑facto administrator rather than a mere supporter of opposition.
