**Bethlehem marks a symbolic return to Christmas festivities on 24 December, a revival that economists estimate will lift the city’s gross domestic product by roughly two percent and inject between US $10 million and US $15 million into a tourism‑driven economy still reeling from two years of conflict.** 

The tree‑lighting ceremony in Manger Square, the first public celebration since the Gaza war began, signalled more than a seasonal cheer. With tourism accounting for about 80 % of municipal revenue, the brief resurgence offers a tangible counterweight to the staggering daily losses recorded during the hostilities – estimates ranging from US $1.8 million to US $2 million per day. Over a full year, that shortfall translates to an estimated US $730 million in foregone income, a figure that approximates Bethlehem’s total economic output given the sector’s dominance.

The festive window, spanning roughly ten days of market activity and pilgrim visits, is projected to recover about half of the pre‑war daily tourism flow. At a conservative US $2 million per day baseline, this partial rebound would generate a direct cash infusion of US $10 million. The multiplier effect typical of service‑oriented economies – where each dollar spent circulates through hotels, restaurants, souvenir shops and transport – is estimated at 1.5 ×. Applying this factor lifts the total impact to US $15 million, representing roughly two percent of the annual tourism benchmark and providing a modest but meaningful boost to municipal finances.

Beyond the balance sheet, the celebrations touch on the social fabric strained by the conflict. Unemployment surged from 14 % to 65 % during the war, while poverty now grips an estimated 60 % of residents and around 4 000 people have left the city in search of stability. The revival of Christmas rituals, attended by families and pilgrims alike, offers a psychological lift that may help stem out‑migration and ease the labour market shock, even if the precise magnitude remains difficult to quantify.

Local officials have framed the event as a beacon of hope. Mayor Maher Canawati, who previously lamented daily tourism losses of US $1.8 million, welcomed the gathering as evidence that Bethlehem’s “spirit and resilience” endure. For a city where the majority of its Muslim‑majority population depends on pilgrim traffic, the return of festive commerce underscores the interdependence of cultural tradition and economic survival.

While the short‑term fiscal gain is modest, the symbolism of a public Christmas celebration after two years of war carries weight for both residents and the broader international community. It signals a tentative step toward normalcy and offers a narrative of renewal that contrasts sharply with the hardship of the preceding months. As Bethlehem navigates the path to recovery, the holiday season may prove to be a catalyst for both economic and social revitalisation, reminding the world that even in the shadow of conflict, the lights of faith and commerce can flicker back to life.
