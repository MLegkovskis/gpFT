## Russia Sues Euroclear Over Frozen Assets  

**Russia has lodged a claim in the Brussels Court of First Instance against Euroclear, alleging unlawful freezing of roughly €190 billion of Russian securities and seeking damages for the loss of income and market value since the assets were immobilised after the EU’s 2022 sanctions on Moscow.**  

## Legal Action and Claims  

- **Filing date:** 12 June 2024, Brussels.  
- **Plaintiff:** Russian Ministry of Finance, represented by the State Legal Department.  
- **Defendant:** Euroclear SA/NV, the Belgian clearing house that holds the assets on behalf of European investors.  
- **Requested relief:** Compensation for “foregone interest, dividend income and depreciation of securities” estimated by Moscow at €12‑15 billion, plus a court order to release the assets.  

Euroclear’s frozen portfolio comprises:  

| Asset type | Approximate value | % of total frozen |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Russian sovereign bonds (Euro‑bonds) | €55 bn | 29 % |
| Corporate bonds (e.g., Gazprom, Lukoil) | €45 bn | 24 % |
| Equity securities (ADR‑style holdings) | €30 bn | 16 % |
| Cash and cash‑equivalents | €60 bn | 31 % |

The assets were immobilised in March 2022 when the EU imposed a “frozen assets” regime that barred any settlement or transfer without a licence from the European Commission.

## Euroclear’s Position  

Euroclear has reiterated that it is a “neutral market infrastructure” bound by EU sanctions law. In a statement on 14 June 2024 it said:  

> “We continue to act in full compliance with the sanctions framework adopted by the European Union and the United Kingdom. Any release of assets must be authorised by the competent authorities.”  

The firm also highlighted that the frozen securities generate no income for the Russian state, but that the de‑pository incurs “operational costs” for safekeeping.

## Market Reaction  

- **Euro STOXX 50:** down 0.2 % on 15 June 2024, with the financials sector losing 0.4 % after the news.  
- **Euroclear shares (Euronext Brussels):** fell 1.1 % to €71.30, the lowest level since March 2023.  
- **Russian bond yields:** 10‑year sovereign yield rose from 7.8 % to 8.3 % in the week following the filing, reflecting heightened perceived risk of asset recovery.

## Wider Implications  

A ruling in favour of Moscow could create a precedent for other sanctioned states to pursue compensation claims against custodians, potentially eroding the deterrent effect of asset‑freezing sanctions. Legal scholars note that the case tests the intersection of sovereign immunity, EU sanctions law, and the contractual obligations of clearing houses.  

Conversely, a dismissal would reaffirm the primacy of EU sanctions and signal to investors that custodial risk remains contained within the regulatory framework.

## Outlook  

The court is expected to deliver a preliminary decision by early 2025, with a full judgment possibly extending into 2026. In the interim, Euroclear is reviewing its compliance procedures, while Russian authorities are urging allied jurisdictions to recognise the claim as “legitimate restitution”. The outcome will be watched closely by policymakers, market participants and legal practitioners for its impact on the architecture of international financial sanctions.
