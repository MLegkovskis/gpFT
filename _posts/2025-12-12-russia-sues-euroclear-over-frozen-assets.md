**Russia’s central bank has lodged a claim in a Moscow arbitration court against Euroclear, the Belgian clearing house that holds the bulk of Moscow’s frozen sovereign assets, accusing it of illegal “damaging actions” that have blocked the Bank of Russia from managing roughly €185 billion of securities and cash.**  

## Background  
Since the EU imposed sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, more than €210 billion of Russian state assets have been immobilised across Europe. Euroclear, which processes the majority of these holdings, has frozen the assets in line with EU regulations. Moscow says the freeze breaches international law and is causing “material damage” to the Bank of Russia.

## The Lawsuit  
The claim, filed on 12 December 2025 in the Moscow Arbitration Court, seeks compensation for losses incurred and an injunction to restore the bank’s access to its funds. In a statement, the Central Bank of Russia said the suit also challenges the European Commission’s ongoing work to channel income from the frozen assets to finance a “reparations loan” for Ukraine.

## EU Plans and Russian Response  
EU officials are preparing a proposal to use the income from the frozen assets to back a €90 billion loan to Kyiv, a move Moscow has labelled “theft”. The Russian court action is intended to “unequivocally” contest any such use, and the Kremlin has warned of possible reciprocal measures against Euroclear’s assets held in Russia.

## Euroclear’s Position  
Euroclear’s chief executive, Valérie Urbain, said the depository will defend itself vigorously, stressing that the assets are held under EU sanctions and that any expropriation could destabilise the international financial system. The firm also noted it has €16‑17 billion of its own assets frozen in Russia.

## Market Implications  
The dispute adds another layer of uncertainty for investors with exposure to Russian securities. Legal outcomes could set precedents for how frozen sovereign assets are treated in future sanction regimes, while the broader standoff underscores the growing financial dimension of the Russia‑Ukraine conflict.
