### US Links Security Guarantees for Ukraine to Peace Deal Ceding Territory
The United States has made its security guarantees for Ukraine contingent on a peace deal that involves Ukraine ceding the Donbas region to Russia. This development has significant implications for the ongoing conflict and the future of Ukraine's territorial integrity.

### Key Players and Their Roles
- **Ukraine**: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity must be upheld in any peace deal, indicating a strong stance against ceding territory.
- **United States**: The US is using its security guarantee as a bargaining chip, promising additional weapons and a long-term guarantee only if Ukraine agrees to the territorial compromise demanded by Russia.
- **Russia**: Russia remains the primary driver of the territorial demand, insisting that the question of territory remains fundamental to any deal. By refusing to engage with EU officials, Moscow forces the negotiation into a US–Ukraine–Russia framework.
- **European Union**: The EU is acting as a supportive but peripheral player, offering long-term political and economic security through future membership and short-term humanitarian aid, such as hundreds of electricity generators. However, the EU is excluded from direct territorial talks due to Russia's refusal to engage with its officials.
