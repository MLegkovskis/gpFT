# Trump Threatens 100% Tariffs on Canada Over China Trade Deal
## Introduction
The threat of a 100% tariff on Canadian goods by the US has significant implications for Canada's economy and trade relationships with the US. This article examines the potential implications of such a tariff and the context surrounding the threat.
## Potential Implications of a 100% Tariff
A 100% tariff on Canadian exports to the US would double the landed cost of every Canadian export, effectively removing the bulk of the $916 billion flow. This would have a significant impact on Canada's economy, including a loss of $200 billion in export revenue, which would shave around 9% off GDP-linked export earnings.
## Key Economic Mechanisms
The key economic mechanisms at play include price shock, supply-chain disruption, energy market shock, employment effects, and fiscal impact. A 100% tariff would make Canadian goods twice as expensive for US buyers, leading to reduced demand and supply-chain disruption. The energy market would also be affected, with potential price spikes and supply-chain disruptions.
## Political and Diplomatic Context
The threat of a 100% tariff is not supported by historical precedent, and the USMCA dispute-settlement provisions would likely be triggered. The claim that Trump threatened a 100% tariff on Canada if it seals a trade deal with China appears unsubstantiated.
## Bottom-Line Implications
The bottom-line implications of a 100% tariff include a loss of 1-1.5% of Canadian GDP, a loss of 100-200k jobs in manufacturing and related services, and higher consumer prices in both the US and Canada.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, the threat of a 100% tariff on Canadian goods by the US has significant implications for Canada's economy and trade relationships with the US. The potential implications of such a tariff are far-reaching and would have a significant impact on Canada's economy.
