# Federal Agents Shoot Man Dead in Minneapolis
## Incident Overview
A fatal shooting occurred on January 24, 2026, in south-side Minneapolis, involving federal immigration officers. The victim, 37-year-old Alex Pretti, was a U.S. citizen and lawful gun owner. The circumstances surrounding the shooting are disputed, with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claiming Pretti was armed and resisted, while witnesses and family members describe a chaotic scene in which Pretti was holding a phone and trying to protect a woman.
## Witness Accounts
Multiple independent witnesses, including a Star Tribune affidavit and NBC's Andrea IkweStrong, describe federal agents using pepper-spray, physically restraining Pretti, and then opening fire while he lay on the ground. The victim's parents publicly refute the DHS claim that Pretti was armed, stating he was holding a phone and trying to protect a woman.
## Official Response
The DHS statement claims Pretti was "armed with a semi-automatic handgun" and "resisted disarmament," prompting an officer to fire "in self-defence" to protect himself and fellow agents. However, witness and family accounts consistently report no visible weapon on Pretti at the moment he was shot, with video frames showing his hand holding a smartphone, not a firearm.
## Aftermath
The incident has sparked clashes between federal agents and protesters, with multiple videos and witness accounts contradicting the official narrative. The Minneapolis Police Chief, Brian O'Hara, confirmed the death and the presence of many agents but did not address the weapon dispute.
