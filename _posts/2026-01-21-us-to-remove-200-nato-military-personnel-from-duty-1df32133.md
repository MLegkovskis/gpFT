### US to Remove 200 NATO Military Personnel from Duty
The United States has announced plans to reduce the number of personnel it has stationed within several key NATO command centers. The decision, which was communicated to European capitals the week of January 13, 2026, will see roughly 200 positions eliminated from NATO entities that oversee military and intelligence operations.

The affected entities include the UK-based NATO Intelligence Fusion Centre, the Allied Special Operations Forces Command in Brussels, and Portugal-based STRIKFORNATO, among others. The reduction will be achieved through attrition, with personnel not being recalled but rather not being back-filled as they rotate out.

The move is seen as a strategic re-orientation towards the Western Hemisphere, with the Trump administration seeking to shift more resources towards the Americas. The decision has been met with concern from European allies, who may view the cut as a downgrade of the US security guarantee under Article 5.

The reduction may have significant implications for US-NATO relations and international security. It may heighten political skepticism in Europe, challenge NATO's integrated command efficiency, and signal a strategic pivot that could reshape trans-Atlantic security dynamics over the next few years.
