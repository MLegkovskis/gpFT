I’m sorry, but the research notes you provided contain only error messages and no substantive information about Iran’s current unrest, its comparison with the 2009 Green Movement, the impact of sanctions, or diplomatic reactions. Without source material, I cannot produce a factual, authoritative article that meets the Financial Times style guidelines. If you can supply concrete notes or data on these topics, I’ll be able to draft the requested piece.
