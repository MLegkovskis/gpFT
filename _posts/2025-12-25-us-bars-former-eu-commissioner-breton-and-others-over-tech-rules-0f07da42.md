**The United States has moved to bar former European Union commissioner Michel Breton, alongside several other senior EU figures, from entering the country on grounds that they have breached American technology‑sector regulations.** The decision, announced by the Department of State late last week, marks a sharp escalation in the trans‑Atlantic tug‑of‑war over digital policy, signalling Washington’s willingness to wield visa restrictions as a tool of enforcement against what it describes as “non‑compliant” foreign officials.

The barred individuals are alleged to have participated in policy‑making that undermines the United States’ approach to data security, platform accountability and market competition. While the precise legal basis for the bans has not been disclosed, officials indicate that the measures fall under the same authority used to deny entry to persons deemed to pose a risk to national security or to the integrity of the US tech ecosystem. The move follows a series of high‑profile confrontations between Washington and Brussels over the Digital Services Act, the EU’s new privacy framework and the broader question of how to police the global operations of American internet giants.

For the European Union, the action is being framed as an “unprecedented intrusion” into its internal decision‑making. Senior EU officials have warned that the bans could erode the spirit of cooperation that underpins the EU‑US Trade and Technology Council, a forum created to align standards on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and supply‑chain resilience. The European Commission’s press office described the US step as “counter‑productive” and urged Washington to engage in dialogue rather than punitive measures.

In Washington, the decision has been defended by senior State Department diplomats who argue that the United States must protect its strategic interests in the digital domain. A senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the bans were “a proportionate response to actions that threaten the level playing field for American innovators.” The official added that the United States remains open to “constructive engagement” but will not shy away from “firm measures when necessary.”

The technology sector on both sides of the Atlantic has reacted with a mixture of alarm and pragmatism. US tech CEOs have expressed concern that the bans could signal a broader trend of using immigration controls to influence foreign policy, potentially complicating talent‑mobility pipelines that have long underpinned Silicon Valley’s growth. Meanwhile, European tech firms fear that the escalation could lead to retaliatory steps, such as tighter data‑transfer restrictions or new compliance burdens for American companies operating in the EU.

Analysts note that the Breton episode is part of a growing pattern of regulatory brinkmanship. Over the past few years, both Washington and Brussels have introduced sweeping legislation aimed at curbing the market power of big platforms, yet their approaches often diverge. The US favours a more market‑driven model, whereas the EU leans toward prescriptive rules that impose explicit duties on online services. The current standoff underscores how these philosophical differences are now spilling over into diplomatic arenas, with personal sanctions becoming an increasingly visible lever.

The longer‑term impact remains uncertain. If the United States continues to employ visa bans as a punitive device, it may compel EU officials to recalibrate their regulatory strategies, or it could provoke a reciprocal response that further fragments the global digital marketplace. For now, the episode serves as a stark reminder that the battle over the rules of the internet is no longer confined to legislative chambers—it is being fought on the very front lines of international mobility.
