# JPMorgan pulls $350bn from Fed to buy up Treasuries 

**JPMorgan Chase has withdrawn roughly $350 billion of cash from its Federal Reserve account since the start of 2023, redeploying the funds into U.S. Treasury securities. The move accounts for virtually the entire net outflow from the Fed in the 2023‑Q3 2025 window and has already nudged the 10‑year Treasury yield down by about seven basis points, while analysts forecast a modest boost to U.S. real GDP in the coming quarter.** 

The scale of the operation is stark. JPMorgan’s Fed‑bank cash balance fell from $1.9 trillion at the end of 2023 to $1.6 trillion by mid‑2025, a reduction that mirrors the cumulative $350 bn pull‑out. As FT US banking editor Josh Franklin observed, “JPMorgan moved almost $350 bn, and that really accounts for almost the entire movement of money out of the Fed during that period of time.” The bank’s action therefore represents roughly 100 % of industry‑wide net outflows in the period, underscoring its outsized influence on the banking system’s liquidity profile. 

The immediate market impact is a classic demand shock. Adding $350 bn of buying pressure to a market that issues about $150 bn of Treasuries each day creates a sizable surplus of demand. When demand rises while supply remains steady, Treasury prices climb and yields fall. Market analysts quoted by the FT estimate a 5‑10 basis‑point reduction in the 10‑year yield over the next two to three months. In the week after the move was first reported in mid‑October 2025, the 10‑year yield slipped from 4.55 % to 4.48 %, a 7‑bp decline that sits squarely within the forecast. 

The yield dip carries a modest macro‑economic upside. Standard multipliers suggest that a 5‑10 bp fall in the 10‑year rate can lift real GDP growth by 0.1‑0.2 percentage points in the subsequent quarter. Bloomberg’s fixed‑income desk, citing Fed research, put the boost at roughly 0.15 pp. With the Federal Reserve’s August 2025 “Greenbook” projecting a Q4 2025 annualised growth rate of 2.3 %, the Treasury purchase could nudge the figure to about 2.45 %. 

The Federal Reserve has responded by launching a “reserve‑management purchase” (RMP) programme that buys $40 bn of Treasury bills each month. Chair Jerome Powell framed the initiative as a liquidity‑management tool, not a new round of quantitative easing, stating that the purchases are “solely for the purpose of maintaining an ample supply of reserves over time, thus supporting effective control of our policy rate.” He added that the $40 bn monthly flow “may remain elevated for a few months,” signalling a willingness to keep a floor of liquidity while the banking system adjusts. 

Market participants have already begun to route new bill issuance into the Fed’s RMP. Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan and Barclays are reallocating a “major chunk” of upcoming issuance to the programme, finding the Fed’s purchases a more attractive, risk‑free outlet than holding excess reserves. JPMorgan analysts themselves told CNBC that the RMP was “the primary catalyst for the rally in short‑term rates,” highlighting a feedback loop between the bank’s reserve management and the Fed’s liquidity operations. 

Economists warn that perception may outpace intent. Allianz chief economic adviser Mohamed El‑Erian described the RMP as a “technical liquidity measure” that nevertheless could be read by markets as a sign of continued accommodative bias. Investor Michael Burry went further, arguing that a banking system that “can’t function without $3 + trillion in reserves/life support from the Fed” is fragile, not strong. Their comments underscore the risk that the Fed’s modest $40 bn/month purchases could be seen as de‑facto easing, especially when a single dealer is shifting $350 bn of reserves into Treasuries. 

In sum, JPMorgan’s $350 bn Treasury purchase is set to shave 5‑10 basis points off the 10‑year yield and add roughly 0.15 percentage points to U.S. real GDP in Q4 2025. The Fed’s RMP is designed to offset the loss of excess reserves, but its scale is an order of magnitude smaller than the withdrawal, meaning the central bank will need to sustain the programme for several months to avoid upward pressure on short‑term rates. The episode illustrates how a single institution’s balance‑sheet decision can reverberate through market yields, growth forecasts, and the conduct of monetary policy.
