# Arm CEO Downplays AI Software Sell-Off as 'Micro-Hysteria' 
 Arm CEO Rene Haas has characterized the recent sell-off in AI software stocks as 'micro-hysteria', indicating that the company does not plan to sell off any of its AI software assets. This move is seen as a strategic decision to preserve the company's 'full-stack' value proposition for customers. 
 
 ## Revenue and Growth 
 Arm reported $1.24 billion in total revenue for Q3 FY2025, with a 26% year-over-year increase. The company's licensing revenue was $505 million, slightly below consensus estimates. Despite this, the company forecasts 'low-teens' royalty growth and 'high-teens' licensing growth for FY2026. 
 
 ## Partnerships and Collaborations 
 Arm's partnerships with companies like Nvidia, Apple, and Meta are expected to remain intact, with the company's CEO emphasizing that the 'micro-hysteria' will not affect long-term partnerships. The company's focus on edge-centric AI deployments and energy-efficient AI stacks is also expected to continue, with partners likely to double down on co-design efforts. 
 
 ## Conclusion 
 The recent AI software sell-off is seen as a short-term market wobble, rather than a structural threat to Arm's business. The company's strategic decision to preserve its AI software division is expected to pay off in the long term, with the company poised for continued growth and success.
