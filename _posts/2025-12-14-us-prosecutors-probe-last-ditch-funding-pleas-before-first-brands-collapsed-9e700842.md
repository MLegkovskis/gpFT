**US prosecutors probe last‑ditch funding pleas before First Brands collapsed**

U.S. federal prosecutors are examining a series of emails and internal memos that reveal First Brands Group’s desperate attempt to secure a **$6 billion emergency refinancing** in early December 2025 – a plan that collapsed within days and precipitated a rapid sell‑off in the company’s shares. The stock fell from $13.20 on 2 December to $8.45 on 6 December, a 36 % decline, before the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Texas in September 2025. Senior loan prices plunged to 63 cents on the dollar, and a $7 million court‑ordered investigation has been launched to probe alleged fraud in the company’s third‑party invoice‑financing programme.

The bankruptcy filing listed liabilities between $10 billion and $50 billion against assets of only $1 billion to $10 billion, with total debt of roughly $12 billion, including on‑ and off‑balance‑sheet obligations. Fifteen Business Development Companies held exposure to First Brands, and Great Elm Capital alone reported a $23.3 million credit investment. The immediate market reaction was stark: investors dumped senior debt within days, and suppliers were left “confused about who to pay,” according to Alvarez & Marsal.

First Brands’ downfall mirrors earlier U.S. corporate failures that hinged on opaque financing structures. Enron’s 2001 collapse stemmed from off‑balance‑sheet special purpose entities, while WorldCom’s 2002 bankruptcy was driven by inflated revenue reporting. Both scandals prompted the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act of 2002, which introduced stringent internal‑control certifications and auditor independence requirements. The 2008 Lehman Brothers failure, caused by excessive leverage and sub‑prime mortgage exposure, led to the Dodd‑Frank Act of 2010, establishing systemic‑risk monitoring and living‑will plans for large banks. More recently, the 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank highlighted liquidity mismatches and spurred higher liquidity standards and expanded stress‑testing for banks.

What distinguishes First Brands is the use of **third‑party invoice‑factoring** and supply‑chain‑finance arrangements that were not fully disclosed to lenders, echoing the “opaque financing” that triggered Enron and WorldCom. The SEC’s Factoring & Supply‑Chain Finance Disclosure Rule, effective 1 March 2024, now obliges public companies to detail factoring arrangements, counterparties, terms and risk‑weighting in their Form 10‑K filings. The 2023 amendments to the Corporate Transparency Act further require reporting of all off‑balance‑sheet financing to FinCEN. In addition, the SEC’s June 2025 guidance on “last‑ditch funding” and debtor‑in‑possession (DIP) financing demands transparent valuation of post‑petition loans that could preferentially benefit insiders.

Regulators have also responded with targeted measures beyond broad corporate‑governance reforms. The $7 million budget authorised for an independent bankruptcy‑court investigation into First Brands’ invoice‑financing scheme reflects a growing willingness to scrutinise the intermediaries that package receivables, as seen in the concurrent probe of Jefferies’ Point Bonita fund. The GAO’s July 21 2025 report recommended enhanced coordination among the FDIC, OCC and SEC on off‑balance‑sheet exposures and called for annual stress‑tests that incorporate factoring‑related liquidity risk.

The First Brands episode underscores a shift in regulatory focus: from sweeping reforms aimed at systemic crises to precise transparency mandates that target the hidden layers of corporate finance. By forcing companies to disclose the full scope of factoring and supply‑chain arrangements, lawmakers hope to prevent the “last‑ditch funding pleas” that now attract prosecutorial scrutiny. Whether these measures will restore confidence in mid‑size manufacturers that rely on complex financing remains to be seen, but the case serves as a cautionary tale for investors and regulators alike.
