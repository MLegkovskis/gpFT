**US prosecutors have opened a criminal probe into the frantic $6 billion “last‑ditch” funding pleas that First Brands Group sent to private‑credit lenders less than a week before it filed for Chapter 11 on 28 September 2025, a move that could reshape how large‑scale auto‑parts bankruptcies are investigated.**  

First Brands entered the courts with a staggering debt profile – $6.1 bn of on‑balance‑sheet borrowings, $2.3 bn of off‑balance‑sheet financing and $0.6 bn of unsecured obligations, putting total liabilities in a court‑filed range of $10 bn‑$50 bn against assets of only $1 bn‑$10 bn【The Secured Lender】.  The company’s $1.1 bn super‑senior DIP loan, supplied by Marathon Asset Management and other private‑credit funds, collapsed to 30 cents on the dollar within weeks, a speed “virtually unprecedented for court‑approved financing”【TTNews】.  Moreover, roughly $2.6 bn of its debt was packaged across 1,100 CLO vehicles managed by more than 80 managers, making it the most concentrated single‑company CLO shock since the Greensill collapse【Moody’s】.

The scale of the failure places First Brands among the five largest post‑2000 U.S. auto‑parts bankruptcies.  Its $9 bn core debt dwarfs Delphi Automotive’s $2.5 bn filing in 2005 and sits within an order of magnitude of Chrysler’s $12 bn 2009 restructuring【Historical table】.  Yet the speed of its demise – ≤ 10 days from the emergency‑funding email to the Chapter 11 petition – eclipses the months‑long processes that characterised Delphi, Chrysler and even GM’s 2009 filing【Feature comparison】.

What distinguishes First Brands is the heavy reliance on private‑credit financing.  The September 20 2025 emails to at least twelve lenders pleaded “critical liquidity” and requested a $1.2 bn bridge loan, a request that was never fulfilled【Reuters – prosecutors probe】.  Analysts note that the $2.6 bn CLO exposure is the largest single‑company shock since Greensill, highlighting the systemic risk posed by opaque private‑credit structures【CNBC】.  By contrast, earlier auto‑industry failures were driven by traditional bank syndicates and government‑backed programmes, with little private‑credit involvement【Feature comparison】.

The involvement of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of Texas marks a departure from prior auto‑sector bankruptcies, which were treated solely as civil restructurings.  Prosecutors are examining whether First Brands misrepresented its financial position or double‑pledged receivables in the bridge‑loan pleas【Reuters – prosecutors probe】.  Robert Grbic of *The Secured Lender* warned that “the rapid descent of First Brands into bankruptcy rattled lending markets,” underscoring the broader market anxiety【SFNet】.  CNBC added that the case “draws comparisons to the subprime mortgage crisis and Greensill Capital’s collapse,” hinting at a potential regulatory tightening of private‑credit markets【CNBC】.

The fallout is already palpable.  Creditors face a $2.6 bn CLO shortfall, while the company’s $5.5 bn annual revenue was barely eclipsed by the $6 bn refinancing package it sought – a request equal to 109 % of its yearly sales【Funding vs revenue】.  The criminal probe may set a precedent, signalling that aggressive, opaque financing arrangements can trigger law‑enforcement scrutiny as well as civil bankruptcy proceedings.

In sum, First Brands’ collapse fuses the debt magnitude of historic auto‑industry failures with the lightning‑fast, privately‑funded financing model of the 2020s, and the ensuing federal investigation could herald a new era of accountability for corporate restructurings in the sector.
