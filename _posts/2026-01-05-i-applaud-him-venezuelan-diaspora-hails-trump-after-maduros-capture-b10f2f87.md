**‘I applaud him’: Venezuelan diaspora hails Trump after Maduro’s capture**

The United States’ night‑time raid that seized President Nicolás Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores on 3 January 2026 has ignited jubilant celebrations across the Venezuelan diaspora, while signalling the climax of a decade‑long Trump‑era strategy that moved from sanctions to kinetic action. In Miami, Buenos Aires, Lima and Madrid crowds shouted “I applaud him” as news spread that the “narco‑state” leader was now in U.S. custody, awaiting drug‑trafficking prosecution in New York. The raid marks the most dramatic escalation of U.S.–Venezuela relations since Donald Trump’s inauguration in 2017, when the administration first branded the Maduro regime a criminal enterprise and began a systematic campaign of economic isolation.

Trump’s press conference on the day of the capture framed the operation as a temporary stewardship: “The United States will run Venezuela until a safe, proper and judicious transition of power can take place.” The promise of “boots on the ground” if required echoes the president’s 2019 declaration that Washington would manage a post‑Guaidó transition, underscoring a continuity of belief that the United States can act as a provisional government. The raid draws on a policy trajectory that began with Executive Order 13808 in August 2017, which imposed a 30 % tariff on Venezuelan oil and froze PDVSA assets, and progressed through the 2019 recognition of Juan Guaidó, sanctions on senior military figures in October 2020, and the covert “Operation Freedom” contingency plan announced in March 2022. The failure of U.S.–backed talks in Barbados in November 2024, which the administration declared a closed window for negotiation, provided the final justification for a unilateral military option.

The diaspora’s response reflects both relief and political calculation. Khaty Yáñez, a Venezuelan activist in Chile, declared, “We are free. We are all happy that the dictatorship has fallen and that we have a free country.” In Buenos Aires, community organiser José Gregorio exclaimed, “My joy is too big. After so many years, after so many struggles, today is the day of freedom.” Miami‑based Yajaira thanked the president, saying, “Thank you, Lord, thank you President of the United States. I’ve been waiting for years — he’s done so much damage. This has been horrible.” Their enthusiasm is amplified by the scale of displacement: roughly 6.9 million Venezuelans live abroad, about 30 % of the pre‑crisis population, with 1.4 million in the United States, 2.3 million in Colombia and 1.8 million in Peru. The diaspora has long been a vocal lobbying bloc, funding opposition NGOs and shaping congressional sanctions bills, and its public celebration now serves as a political lever for Washington.

Analysts anticipate a mixed impact on oil markets. Jorge León of Rystad Energy warned of a short‑term bullish spike in geopolitical risk, while noting that a stable, pro‑investment government could eventually depress prices as Venezuela’s 303 billion barrels of proven reserves re‑enter global supply. The immediate market reaction was modest: Brent slipped to $60.62 a barrel and WTI to $57.12 a barrel on 4 January 2026. Rystad’s broader note likened post‑capture Venezuela to post‑Gaddafi Libya—fragmented opposition and lingering Chavismo could keep sanctions in place for six to twelve months, sustaining elevated prices until a clear governance structure emerges.

Diplomatically, the capture is likely to accelerate a shift in recognition from Maduro to opposition figures such as María Corina Machado, who has pledged to work with any partner guaranteeing free elections. Regional actors hosting large refugee populations—Colombia and Peru—have already signalled willingness to cooperate with Washington on border security and humanitarian corridors. Canada’s mixed statements suggest alignment with U.S. sanctions while urging a multilateral UN‑led peace process, adding weight to a transitional framework that could gain broader international legitimacy.

In sum, the seizure of Nicolás Maduro is the logical endpoint of a policy that repeatedly warned “the time for talk is over.” The diaspora’s jubilant chants provide the moral cover the administration sought, while the world watches to see whether the United States can translate a dramatic raid into a credible, democratic transition that unlocks Venezuela’s oil wealth and restores stability to a region long destabilised by authoritarian rule.
