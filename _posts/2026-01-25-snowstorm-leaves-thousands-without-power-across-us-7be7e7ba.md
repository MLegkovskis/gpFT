### Winter Storm Leaves Thousands Without Power Across US
A massive winter storm has swept across the US, leaving thousands of households without power. Local authorities, including electric cooperatives and municipal emergency management offices, have launched a coordinated effort to restore power and provide aid to those affected.

The storm has caused at least three confirmed deaths, with no publicly reported injury counts. Emergency response efforts are extensive, with federal disaster declarations, FEMA asset pre-positioning, and a coordinated Red Cross effort with over 360 responders and 125 warming centers.

Power-restoration crews are on the ground, but approximately 95,000 customers remain without electricity, and full restoration is expected to take several days. The storm has also caused significant disruptions to transportation, with over 8,000 flights canceled and major highways closed.

Local authorities are working to clear ice-laden lines and restore power, with safety protocols in place to prevent further accidents. Mutual-aid agreements have been activated, moving crews across state lines to assist with the response efforts.
