### Xi’s Purge of Top General Sends China’s Military into Uncharted Waters

The recent purge of Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission Zhang Youxia and senior officer Liu Zhenli has sent China’s military into uncharted waters. The removal of these top generals has reduced the CMC to just 2 members, with Xi Jinping as Chairman and General Zhang Shengmin as Vice-Chairman. This concentration of power has eliminated the traditional collective leadership model, with decision-making now resting almost entirely on Xi and his trusted aide.

The purge has significant implications for China’s military hierarchy and chain of command. The loss of senior commanders may temporarily degrade combat readiness and cause cautious, slower decision-making. The removal of approximately 20 senior generals since 2022, including 6 from the Rocket Force, has raised questions about the reliability of China’s land-based missile arsenal and nuclear deterrent credibility.

The absence of a senior, battle-tested commander may delay or reshape any near-term invasion plans for Taiwan. Xi’s rhetoric remains aggressive, but the lack of experienced leadership may impact the timing and execution of such plans.

The purge also has implications for China’s relationships with other nations, particularly in the context of regional security and diplomacy. However, due to research limitations, the full extent of these implications is unclear.

### Conclusion

Xi’s purge of top general Zhang Youxia has significant implications for China’s military and regional security. The concentration of power, potential disruption to military readiness, and impact on strategic missile readiness and nuclear command-and-control processes all contribute to a bearish/negative sentiment.
