### US National Defence Strategy to Counter China in Indo-Pacific
The US has unveiled a national defence strategy to counter China's growing presence in the Indo-Pacific region. The strategy focuses on diplomacy and economic cooperation, with the goal of reducing dependence on Chinese supply chains and promoting a rules-based order.

The strategy involves investing in Indo-Pacific infrastructure, including harbor upgrades and air-field improvements, as well as congressional funding requests to support these efforts. Diplomatic engines like the Quad and AUKUS are also key components, providing a framework for enhanced economic cooperation and security guarantees.

Economic cooperation is a strategic instrument used to strengthen allies' resilience and pressure China to conform to a rules-based order. The US has pledged $100 billion in private-sector investment over the next five years for clean energy, digital trade, and supply-chain diversification through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).

The strategy also involves targeted economic measures on China, including ending predatory subsidies, unfair trading practices, and intellectual-property theft. The US aims to win hearts-and-minds in the Global South through aid, infrastructure financing, and trade deals that compete with China's Belt-and-Road Initiative.

### Integration of Diplomacy and Economic Cooperation
The US strategy integrates diplomacy and economic cooperation through several key elements, including alliance-centric diplomacy, economic-security tools, development and investment outreach, supply-chain diversification, and technology and standards diplomacy.

These elements work together to create a comprehensive approach to countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. The strategy quantifies this approach, with investments totaling $4 billion, $982 million, $100 billion, $1 billion, $250 million, and $1.2 billion in various initiatives.

### Conclusion
The US national defence strategy to counter China in the Indo-Pacific region is a comprehensive approach that integrates diplomacy and economic cooperation. The strategy aims to reduce dependence on Chinese supply chains, promote a rules-based order, and strengthen allies' resilience. With a focus on economic cooperation and diplomacy, the US is well-positioned to counter China's growing presence in the region.
