**Fine wine investors find little cheer in third year of falls, but a tentative recovery looms in 2026** 

The fine‑wine market has endured three consecutive years of price erosion, leaving investors wary after a 25‑30 % slide from the 2022‑23 peak. Yet a growing chorus of industry insiders and fund managers now signals a modest upside for 2026, with projected portfolio returns of 7‑10 % and a gradual return of liquidity to secondary‑market platforms. The picture remains mixed: optimism is edging ahead of pessimism, but structural headwinds in mature markets and climate‑related vintage variability temper expectations.

A 2025 survey of Italian wine‑industry insiders found 46 % of respondents optimistic about fine‑wine performance in 2026, compared with 39 % who were negative. Analysts at *The Luxury Playbook* forecast a 7 %‑10 % annual return for a diversified fine‑wine portfolio next year, assuming the modest price appreciation observed in the final months of 2025 continues. Liv‑Ex indices support that view: the Fine Wine 50 and Fine Wine 100 rose 2.5 % over the last four months of 2025, while the Fine Wine 1000 added 1 %, though all remain well below their recent highs.

Liquidity, a key barometer of market health, showed a 15 % year‑on‑year increase in trading volume on major secondary‑market platforms such as CultX and Vin‑X during Q4 2025. This uptick suggests a cautious return of buyer confidence after the two‑year correction that began in 2023. Institutional capital is also beginning to flow back. Sovereign Resources, in an October 2025 piece, warned that “platforms lower the barriers to entry and institutional capital flows in, 2026 may be a breakout year for wine investing.”

Macroeconomic conditions are favourable. The Liv‑Ex 50 index has a strong inverse correlation with the UK Bank of England base rate, and rates are expected to stay below 4 % through 2026, keeping real‑asset alternatives such as fine wine attractive to investors seeking yield in a low‑interest‑rate environment.

Fund managers are positioning for a “steady‑state recovery.” Treasury Wine Estates, in its December 2025 investor update, announced plans to tighten supply for the 2026 vintage, targeting a two‑to‑three‑vintage inventory balance to protect price stability. The firm anticipates moderate price appreciation as inventories normalise. CultX’s portfolio manager John Miller echoed this sentiment, noting that the market remains 30 % below its 2022 high, offering ample buying‑opportunity space in top‑tier Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne.

Geographic demand dynamics add nuance. In China, depletions grew 21 % in the three months to October 2025, driven by the Mid‑Autumn festival, and are expected to remain positive though slower in 2026. In the United States, luxury‑portfolio sourcing is shifting toward owned or leased vineyards and long‑term grower contracts, a trend that should improve supply‑chain resilience.

Risk factors persist. Consumption in mature markets such as Europe and the United States continues to decline, offset only partially by premiumisation in emerging economies. Climate‑change‑induced vintage variability remains a source of long‑term volatility, underscoring the need for careful selection and diversification.

**Bottom‑line assessment** – The convergence of modest index gains, renewed institutional interest and a supportive macro backdrop points to 2026 as the first year of a post‑correction recovery. Nonetheless, prices are still 25‑30 % below peak levels, and demand in traditional markets remains soft. Investors are advised to focus on high‑quality, low‑supply vintages, maintain a 2‑3‑vintage inventory buffer, and monitor UK interest‑rate trends as a proxy for broader sentiment.

**Strategic recommendation** – Allocate capital to core regions—Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne—store bottles professionally, and employ disciplined buying during the price‑dislocation window. Patience and a long‑term view remain essential in a market that is still finding its footing after three years of decline.
