### No Laughing Matter: Lebanon's Crackdown on Comedians
The Lebanese government has been taking a hardline stance against comedians, using laws related to defamation, insult, and blasphemy to detain, fine, or investigate them. This crackdown has raised concerns about freedom of speech and the limits of artistic expression in the country.

Several comedians have faced legal action for their jokes, including Shaden Fakih, Nour Hajjar, Mario Moubarak, Hisham Haddad, and Qassem Jaber. These comedians have been accused of insulting the armed forces, harming the reputation of state institutions, and inciting sectarian discord. Some have been arrested, fined, or had their passports confiscated.

The comedians and human rights organizations view these actions as a form of censorship and an attempt to silence criticism of the government and religious institutions. As one comedian noted, 'Satire is the only weapon we have against those who think they are untouchable. If a joke lands you in court, then the system is broken.'

The use of military courts and the Military Prosecutor's office to try comedians has also been criticized. The Military Court has been used to try civilians, including comedians, for crimes such as insulting the armed forces or harming the reputation of state institutions. This has raised concerns about the independence of the judiciary and the fairness of the trials.

The crackdown on comedians is part of a broader pattern of repression in Lebanon, where the government has been using laws related to defamation, insult, and blasphemy to silence critics and opponents. This has created a chilling effect on freedom of speech, with many people afraid to speak out against the government or religious institutions for fear of being arrested or prosecuted.
