**FT Person of the Year: Jensen Huang**
### **Nvidia's CEO Spearheads AI Revolution, Sparking Regulatory Scrutiny and Industry Acclaim**
The Financial Times is proud to announce Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, as our Person of the Year for 2025. Under Huang's visionary leadership, Nvidia has revolutionized the technology landscape, driving the global AI boom and transforming the company into the world's most valuable public entity. This distinction reflects not only Huang's remarkable achievements but also the profound impact of his strategic vision on the future of tech policy and innovation.

Over the past year, Nvidia's market capitalization has surged by **37%** to $4.51 trillion, with a peak market capitalization of $5 trillion in June 2024, making it the first U.S. firm to reach this milestone. The company's share price has also experienced a **34.77%** gain over the same period, far outpacing the broader market. Nvidia's revenue has exploded, with a **265%** year-over-year increase in Q4 2023, driven by unprecedented demand for AI chips. Analysts project FY 2024 revenue to reach $27 billion, reinforcing the valuation premium. Huang's personal net worth has risen to $100 billion, largely from Nvidia equity gains, underscoring how his leadership translates directly into shareholder wealth.

Huang's leadership has not only driven Nvidia's success but has also forced the entire ecosystem to innovate faster, as acknowledged by AMD CEO Lisa Su. His public demand forecasts, such as the "$0.5 trillion" cumulative demand through 2026, have repeatedly triggered short-term price spikes and underpin the long-term valuation premium. As SoftBank's Masayoshi Son noted, Huang's ability to turn a niche graphics chip into a global AI platform is a testament to his visionary entrepreneurship.

The recognition of Huang as FT Person of the Year has sparked a range of reactions from industry leaders, politicians, and regulators. Nvidia's official accounts have positioned the award as a validation of the company's strategic vision and its role in driving the AI boom. Other industry leaders, such as AMD's Lisa Su and Microsoft's Satya Nadella, have acknowledged Huang's impact on the competitive dynamics of the tech industry. Elon Musk has likened the AI hardware race to a "war," suggesting that AI hardware dominance may be perceived as a national-security issue.

Regulatory bodies have also taken notice of Huang's selection, with the EU's Executive Vice President for Competition, Marguerite Vestager, expressing concerns about Nvidia's dominant position in the AI chip market. The US Federal Trade Commission has launched an investigation into Nvidia's AI chip pricing, while the European Commission has announced plans to boost AI chip research funding to reduce reliance on a single supplier.

The collective reaction to Huang's selection as FT Person of the Year reflects the growing importance of the technology sector in the global economy. As policymakers and regulators navigate the complexities of AI-driven innovation, they are likely to balance the rapid pace of technological advancement with safeguards against monopoly power and geopolitical risk. The recognition of Huang's achievements serves as a catalyst for this critical conversation, underscoring the need for a nuanced approach to tech policy that fosters innovation while protecting the public interest.
