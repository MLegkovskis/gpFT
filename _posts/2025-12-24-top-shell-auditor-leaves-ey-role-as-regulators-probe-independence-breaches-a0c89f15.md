**Shell’s top audit partner quits EY as the UK regulator launches a formal probe, sending the oil‑major’s shares down 2 % and wiping roughly $12 billion off its market capitalisation.** The departure of Andrew Miller, EY’s longest‑serving audit partner on Shell’s accounts, follows the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) decision on 21 October to investigate possible breaches of UK audit‑partner‑rotation rules. Investors reacted swiftly, with the stock opening 1.8 % lower on 11 December and closing the day down 2.0 % at $23.12.

The sequence of events began on 15 July 2025, when Shell disclosed in a regulatory filing that EY’s lead audit partner had exceeded the five‑to‑seven‑year tenure limit, having served for nine years. The FRC’s Conduct Committee formally opened its investigation on 21 October, focusing on whether EY had violated the rotation rule and the required cooling‑off periods. EY responded on 19 July by reassigning the audit lead to a new partner and pledged full cooperation. By 21 October, EY’s UK Managing Partner, John Rogers, announced a firm‑wide review of partner‑rotation controls, while the firm’s audit committee introduced a second‑layer sign‑off for any partner who might breach the threshold.

Shell’s leadership has been equally vocal. CEO Wael Sawan, in the July filing, affirmed the company’s expectation of “the highest standards of audit independence” and promised remedial steps. Board Chair Albert Manifold echoed this stance, describing the integrity of financial reporting as “non‑negotiable”. The Investor Relations team reiterated ongoing cooperation with the FRC and a commitment to keep shareholders informed.

The market impact of Miller’s resignation was immediate. On 11 December, Shell shares opened at $23.45, down from $23.96 the previous close, before slipping to a low of $22.97 intraday. The closing price of $23.12 translated into an estimated $12 billion erosion of market capitalisation, based on roughly 1.2 billion ordinary shares outstanding. The share‑price movement, a decline of between 1.8 % and 2.0 %, underscores the sensitivity of investors to perceived weaknesses in audit governance at a blue‑chip energy group.

Regulators have signalled that the probe could have material consequences. The FRC’s Enforcement Division, still conducting its inquiry, has indicated that any final report may lead to sanctions or remedial orders, though no deadline has been set. The agency has pledged to act “swiftly and proportionately” to safeguard audit quality across the UK’s largest listed companies.

EY’s internal response includes an “independence review” launched in October, the appointment of a new audit partner on 18 July, and the establishment of an additional sign‑off layer to prevent future rotation breaches. These steps aim to restore confidence not only in the Shell audit but also in EY’s broader assurance practice, which has faced heightened scrutiny after previous high‑profile independence failures.

The episode highlights the growing regulatory focus on audit partner tenure and the tangible market repercussions when firms fall short of statutory expectations. As the FRC’s investigation proceeds, both Shell and EY will be judged on the robustness of their corrective actions and the speed with which they can reassure investors that the integrity of the company’s financial reporting remains intact.
