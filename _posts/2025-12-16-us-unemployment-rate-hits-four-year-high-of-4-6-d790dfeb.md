**US unemployment climbs to 4.6 % in November, marking the highest level in four years and prompting a cautious response from the Federal Reserve.** The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that the unemployment rate rose from 4.4 % in September to 4.6 % in November 2025, while payroll jobs added a modest 64,000 after a loss of 105,000 in October. The labour‑force participation rate (LFPR) remained unchanged at 62.5 % year‑on‑year, underscoring a labour market that is slipping but not retreating dramatically.

The rise in unemployment arrives at a time when inflation is still above the Fed’s 2 % target, standing at 2.9 % year‑on‑year. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signalled that the data would be “watched very closely” and that the recent uptick “is something the Fed will take seriously”. Yet his tone was measured; he did not announce any immediate adjustment to the policy rate, which was left unchanged at 5.25 % following the December 2025 FOMC meeting. Instead, Powell highlighted the uncertainty surrounding payroll figures, suggesting that the BLS may be overstating job growth by as much as 60,000 positions each month. This caveat reinforced a “pause” stance, with the Fed opting to await clearer trends before moving the needle on interest rates.

Powell’s remarks at the December 15 dot‑plot release added nuance. While acknowledging that the labour market “remains resilient”, he noted that the higher unemployment rate would be a factor in deliberations on the policy path. The dot‑plot projected unemployment at 4.5 % by year‑end 2025 and a modest decline to 4.4 % in 2026, implying that the Fed expects the current spike to be temporary. In a subsequent USA Today interview, Powell warned that a sustained unemployment rate above 4.5 % could shift the balance toward a more accommodative stance, but he stressed that “we are not moving yet”. The implication is that any future rate cuts will be contingent on a prolonged rise in unemployment coupled with a measurable easing of inflation pressures.

The unchanged LFPR of 62.5 %—identical to the figure recorded in November 2024—suggests that the pool of potential workers has stabilised after years of gradual decline. The BLS noted that the participation rate has “remained in a narrow range of 62.5 percent to 62.7 percent”, indicating that the labour market’s depth is not eroding further. However, the employment‑population ratio slipped slightly to 59.6 %, hinting that while more people are available for work, fewer are actually employed.

Analysts interpret the data as a warning sign rather than a crisis. The modest job gains in November, combined with the unchanged participation rate, point to a labour market that is losing momentum but still retaining a degree of resilience. The Fed’s cautious approach reflects a balancing act: it must temper inflation without stifling the fragile recovery. Should unemployment remain above the 4.5 % threshold for an extended period, the Fed may consider easing policy, but any such move will be data‑driven and incremental.

In sum, the November 2025 jobs report paints a picture of a US economy at a crossroads. A four‑year‑high unemployment rate, steady participation, and persistent inflation create a complex backdrop for monetary policy. Powell’s measured rhetoric and the Fed’s decision to hold rates steady underscore a preference for patience, with future adjustments hinging on whether the labour market’s softness deepens or proves transitory.
