**U.S. oil majors say they will only pour billions into Venezuela if Washington supplies iron‑clad guarantees, a demand that could reshape the country’s ailing oil sector and lift its sagging economy.** Analysts estimate that roughly **US $54 billion** over the next 15 years would be needed merely to keep output at the 2023 level of about 1.1 million barrels per day. An additional **US $8‑9 billion a year** would be required to push production beyond 1.4 million barrels per day, while a full return to early‑2010s output of roughly 2.5 million barrels per day would demand **US $80‑90 billion** in capital. The scale of the investment mirrors the size of the country’s reserves – the Orinoco Belt still holds an estimated **300 billion barrels** of extra‑heavy crude – but the willingness to commit funds hinges on a package of legal, fiscal and sanctions‑related assurances from the United States.

The economic payoff could be substantial. Restoring production to the 1.5‑2 million‑barrel range is projected to lift Venezuela’s annual GDP growth by **2‑3 percentage points**, moving the nation from a low‑single‑digit or negative trajectory to a **2‑4 %** expansion by the early 2030s. Oil accounts for about a third of the country’s output, and each extra 100,000 barrels per day historically adds roughly half a percentage point to growth. Consequently, the **$54 billion‑plus** investment package is seen as a potential catalyst for a modest but meaningful economic recovery, provided the political and sanctions‑related risks are mitigated.

The demand for guarantees marks a stark departure from the investment climate of the 1990s and early 2000s. During that era, a liberal‑investment regime – the “Oil Opening” – invited U.S. majors such as Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil to pour an estimated **US $65 billion** into joint‑venture projects. Contracts were generally honoured until the mid‑2000s, when a wave of state‑control measures, strikes and eventual expropriations drove output down from a 1998 peak of 3.5 million barrels per day to around one million barrels by 2007. Risk mitigation then relied on post‑fact arbitration, with around **60 legal claims** totalling **US $20‑30 billion** in potential awards.

In 2026, U.S. executives are far more cautious. Senior leaders of the “big‑four” majors have repeatedly warned that any large‑scale capital must be underpinned by a **U.S.‑backed financial back‑stop** capable of covering five to ten years of revenue shortfalls. They also demand **security guarantees** for personnel and equipment, citing the threat of kidnapping, sabotage and the absence of reliable state protection. Treasury advisers are reportedly exploring back‑stop guarantees that could cover up to a decade of operating losses, a move that would unlock **$15‑$25 billion** of capex for field development and refinery upgrades.

Venezuelan officials, for their part, are signalling a willingness to meet those demands. Minister of Petroleum Nicolás Rodríguez has said the country is “open to a deal that gives investors security and a clear legal framework,” hinting at long‑term production‑sharing contracts, tax holidays and reduced royalties. A White House briefing underscored that proceeds from Venezuelan crude would be routed to **U.S.-controlled accounts** at globally recognised banks, a mechanism designed to allay concerns over revenue misappropriation.

If the guarantee package materialises, the rewards could be compelling. Unlocking even a modest increase of **500,000‑1 million barrels per day** would generate **$30‑$40 billion** of annual revenue at current oil prices, providing a lucrative market for U.S. downstream firms and giving Washington strategic leverage over a key energy source. Conversely, the risks remain pronounced: lingering U.S. sanctions, the need for OFAC licences, volatile exchange rates and the spectre of renewed expropriation all loom large.

In short, the future of U.S. investment in Venezuela hinges on a delicate balance between massive capital requirements and the provision of robust, pre‑emptive guarantees. Should Washington deliver the legal and financial safety nets demanded by the majors, the infusion of tens of billions of dollars could revive a once‑mighty oil sector and inject a much‑needed boost to an economy teetering on the brink of prolonged decline.
