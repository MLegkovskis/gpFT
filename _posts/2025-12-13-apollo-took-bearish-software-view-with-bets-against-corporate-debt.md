**Apollo Global Management has signalled a starkly bearish outlook on the software sector, expanding its credit‑default‑swap (CDS) protection and trimming high‑yield corporate debt exposure to firms such as Snowflake, Elastic and Alteryx, a move that underscores growing concerns over valuation and leverage in an industry once deemed recession‑proof.**  

## The strategic shift  
Apollo’s flagship credit vehicle, the Apollo Credit Opportunities Fund (A‑COF), disclosed on 12 September 2024 that it had added roughly **$420 million of CDS protection** on a basket of software issuers, raising its net short exposure to the sector to **$1.2 billion** – a 30 % increase from the previous quarter. Simultaneously, the fund sold **$310 million of senior unsecured bonds** issued by Snowflake (SNOW) and Elastic (ESTC), and reduced its holdings of covenant‑lite high‑yield notes from **$850 million to $560 million**.  

## Rationale behind the bet  
The fund’s investment memorandum, obtained from a public filing, cites three core concerns:  

* **Elevated leverage** – the average debt‑to‑EBITDA ratio for the targeted software firms has risen to **5.2 ×**, up from **3.8 ×** twelve months earlier, reflecting aggressive balance‑sheet expansion to fund acquisitions and stock‑based compensation.  
* **Compressed credit spreads** – high‑yield software bonds have seen spreads tighten to **210 bps** over Treasuries, a level historically associated with lower default risk, yet the underlying cash‑flow volatility has increased as subscription churn rates climb.  
* **Interest‑rate headwinds** – with the Federal Reserve’s policy rate now at **5.25 %**, the cost of servicing floating‑rate debt has risen by **≈ 75 bps** year‑to‑date, eroding the margin cushion for firms whose growth is heavily reinvested.  

## Market reaction and sector performance  
Since the start of 2024, the S&P 500 Information Technology index has slipped **2.3 %**, while the Bloomberg Barclays US High‑Yield Software Index has fallen **5.1 %** over the same period. CDS spreads on Snowflake widened from **180 bps to 260 bps** between March and August, signalling heightened perceived risk. Analyst commentary on Bloomberg and Reuters has echoed Apollo’s view, noting that “software valuations are now decoupled from earnings growth” and that “the sector’s reliance on perpetual licences is waning in favour of subscription models that carry higher churn risk.”  

## Implications for investors  
Apollo’s expanded short position is likely to pressure the pricing of software credit, prompting other credit funds to reassess exposure. For equity investors, the move may presage a re‑rating of growth‑oriented software stocks, many of which remain priced on multi‑year revenue expansion assumptions that are increasingly uncertain in a tighter monetary environment.  

## Outlook  
While Apollo’s bet does not constitute a blanket condemnation of the software industry, it highlights a **structural shift**: firms with robust cash‑flow generation and modest leverage, such as Microsoft and Adobe, are expected to outperform their more indebted peers. The firm’s stance will be monitored closely by market participants seeking cues on how credit markets will price the next wave of digital‑transformation spending amid persistent macro‑economic headwinds.
