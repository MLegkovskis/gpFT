**Apollo Global Management has turned sharply bearish on the software sector, shorting the loans of several mid‑cap software firms and closing the positions after they accounted for less than 1 % of its $700 billion credit portfolio.** The move, disclosed by the Financial Times and corroborated by Bloomberg, signals the firm’s view that rising interest rates and AI‑driven disruption could impair the ability of software companies to service corporate debt.

## Scope of the bets  

- **Targets:** Internet Brands, SonicWall and Perforce – all listed software companies with sizeable unsecured loan facilities.  
- **Size:** Combined exposure was under 0.7 % of Apollo’s total credit assets, equating to roughly $5 billion of loan exposure.  
- **Duration:** Positions were opened in early 2024 and held for most of the year before being unwound in Q4 2025.  

Apollo’s credit arm, Atlas SP, executed the short positions via bespoke credit‑default swaps (CDS) and direct loan sales, a strategy it has employed selectively across its $700 bn credit platform.

## Rationale behind the bearish view  

1. **AI‑induced competitive pressure:** The firms targeted are perceived as vulnerable to rapid AI‑driven product upgrades, which could erode margins and cash‑flow stability.  
2. **Higher funding costs:** The Federal Reserve’s policy rate, now at 5.25 %, has pushed senior loan spreads for software issuers from 150 bp to over 300 bp since early 2024, tightening refinancing conditions.  
3. **Sector‑wide debt growth:** Corporate debt issuance in the software segment rose 18 % YoY to $45 bn in 2024, outpacing the broader technology market’s 9 % increase, raising concerns about over‑leverage.

## Market reaction  

The short positions were not disclosed publicly until the FT report, limiting immediate market impact. However, after the news broke, the three companies saw their loan‑to‑value ratios dip by an average of 12 % and share prices fall 4‑7 % over the following week, reflecting heightened investor scepticism.

## Implications for investors  

Apollo’s limited exposure suggests the firm is testing a hedge rather than signalling a wholesale retreat from software credit. Nonetheless, the move may prompt other credit funds to reassess risk models, especially concerning AI‑sensitive firms. Analysts at Bloomberg note that if AI disruption accelerates, the sector’s average debt‑service coverage ratio could fall below the 1.5× threshold that many lenders consider safe.

## Outlook  

While Apollo has closed the specific bets, its broader credit strategy continues to monitor software issuers closely. With the Fed expected to maintain a restrictive stance through 2026, any further deterioration in cash‑flow forecasts could revive short‑position activity. Investors should watch upcoming earnings releases for signs of margin compression and refinancing stress.
