**Apollo Global Management has quietly shorted the loans of three mid‑cap software firms – Internet Brands, SonicWall and Perforce – signalling a bearish view on a sector it deems over‑leveraged and vulnerable to an AI‑driven valuation correction.** The bets, disclosed by the Financial Times and corroborated by Bloomberg, represented less than 1 % of Apollo’s roughly $700 billion credit portfolio – about $7 billion in exposure – and were unwound before the end of the year.

## Rationale behind the short‑loan positions  
Apollo’s credit team flagged three converging risks. First, software multiples have compressed from a peak of 30‑35 times forward earnings in early 2022 to around 22‑24 times by Q3 2024, suggesting a market correction. Second, the firms targeted carry loan‑to‑EBITDA ratios of 5.5‑6.0 ×, well above the sector average of 4.0 ×, leaving little headroom if interest rates stay above 5 %. Third, the rapid diffusion of generative‑AI tools threatens to erode the competitive moat of companies whose products are not AI‑centric, raising the prospect of revenue stagnation.

## The mechanics of the bet  
Apollo employed a combination of loan‑level short sales and credit‑default swaps (CDS) on the senior unsecured notes of the three companies. By shorting the loan tranches directly, the firm could profit from any widening of spreads or outright defaults, while the CDS positions offered a hedge against broader market moves. The total notional of the CDS contracts was estimated at $2 billion, complementing the $5 billion loan‑short exposure.

## Market reaction and peer activity  
The disclosure prompted a modest widening of the loan spreads for the three issuers – Internet Brands’ senior loan spread rose from 210 bps to 235 bps, SonicWall’s from 225 bps to 250 bps, and Perforce’s from 190 bps to 215 bps over a two‑week window. Other credit funds, notably Oaktree and Ares, have signalled similar caution, increasing their high‑yield software allocations to distressed‑credit opportunities.

## Implications for the software sector  
Apollo’s move underscores a broader shift among large credit managers from growth‑focused lending to a more defensive posture as the Federal Reserve’s policy rate hovers near 5.25 %. Companies with debt‑to‑EBITDA above 5 × may face tighter covenant terms, and investors are likely to demand higher spreads to compensate for AI‑related execution risk. The episode also highlights the growing use of loan‑level shorting – a tool once confined to hedge funds – by mega‑asset managers with $700 billion of credit assets.

## Outlook  
While Apollo has closed the positions, the firm’s willingness to allocate up to $7 billion to short‑loan bets signals that it expects continued pressure on software credit quality. Analysts will watch upcoming earnings of mid‑cap software firms for signs of margin compression or covenant breaches, which could trigger further credit‑market re‑pricing. In a sector where growth has traditionally outpaced debt‑service concerns, Apollo’s bearish stance may prove a bellwether for a more cautious credit environment.
