**Apollo Global Management’s credit arm has taken a pronounced short position in corporate debt issued by high‑growth software firms, signalling a bearish outlook on the sector as rising interest rates and stretched valuations raise doubts about debt‑service capacity.** The move, disclosed in September 2024, involves roughly $1 billion of short exposure across senior unsecured notes of companies such as Snowflake, ServiceNow and Atlassian, and follows a 15 % decline in software price‑to‑sales multiples since Q2 2023.  

## Investment thesis  

Apollo’s credit team argues that the software industry’s growth engine – largely powered by cloud‑based subscriptions – is now vulnerable to a tighter monetary environment. With the U.S. 10‑year Treasury yield at 4.6 % (up from 3.2 % a year earlier), the cost of refinancing has risen sharply, eroding the spread advantage that high‑margin software firms previously enjoyed. The firm therefore expects a correction in debt prices and a potential rise in default risk for companies that rely heavily on perpetual‑growth assumptions.  

## Market context  

The broader software market has seen a slowdown in revenue acceleration, with the S&P 500 software index falling 8 % year‑to‑date and forward‑looking earnings revisions trending negative across the sector. At the same time, credit spreads on high‑yield software bonds have widened from an average of 3.2 % over Treasuries in early 2023 to 5.1 % in September 2024, reflecting investor scepticism.  

## Apollo’s strategy  

Apollo’s approach combines outright short sales of existing bonds with the purchase of credit default swaps (CDS) to amplify exposure. The $1 billion short position is split roughly 60 % in direct bond sales and 40 % in CDS contracts, targeting issuers with investment‑grade ratings that have recently been downgraded to high‑yield. By focusing on firms with stable cash flows but limited balance‑sheet flexibility, Apollo aims to profit from price declines while limiting upside risk.  

## Implications and outlook  

If other credit investors emulate Apollo’s stance, the software debt market could experience heightened volatility and further spread compression. A sustained rise in rates would increase refinancing costs, potentially prompting covenant breaches or restructurings. Conversely, a rapid deceleration in inflation could stabilise rates, allowing the sector to re‑price on fundamentals rather than macro‑driven risk.  

## Conclusion  

Apollo’s bearish bet underscores a growing consensus that the software boom may be entering a correction phase, driven by macro‑economic headwinds and valuation fatigue. While the sector remains a cornerstone of modern economies, its debt profile is now under closer scrutiny, and investors will be watching closely for signs of stress in the coming quarters.
