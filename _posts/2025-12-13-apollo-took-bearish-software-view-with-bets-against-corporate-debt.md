**Apollo's Bearish Software View: A High-Risk, High-Reward Strategy**
=================================================================

**Apollo Global Management's recent bets against the loans of several software makers vulnerable to AI-driven disruption have sparked a debate in the industry**. The firm's bearish view on software aligns with historical trends in the tech industry and previous market downturns, where credit spreads widened, and high-leverage firms faltered. Apollo's strategy is a high-conviction, balance-sheet-backed hedge that leverages its Athene-derived permanent capital to take sizable short positions in both software equities and corporate debt.

According to Bloomberg, Apollo's bet is a "quality-over-growth" credit play, which expects a spread widening of 150-200 basis points on the targeted loan pool over the next 12-18 months. The firm's exposure to software loans is estimated to be around $1 billion, with a focus on firms with EBITDA-to-debt ratios of less than 2.5 times and AI-exposure scores above 70%. This strategic move is reminiscent of the 2000-2002 "quality-over-growth" shift, when investors fled over-leveraged, high-growth software companies and re-priced credit risk.

**Industry experts and rival investors have weighed in on Apollo's strategy**, with Blackstone's credit chief, Jonathan Gray, warning of a "software bubble" and KKR's co-CEO, Joe Bae, cautioning about liquidity risk. Berkshire Hathaway's Vice-Chair, Ajit Jain, has also expressed concerns about the use of insurance-derived capital for high-risk bets. The implications of Apollo's strategy are far-reaching, with potential ripple effects on the broader market, including wider high-yield spreads, tighter credit conditions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny.

**Historical precedent supports Apollo's strategy**, with credit-focused funds that shorted over-leveraged software debt during the 2008-2009 crisis earning approximately 12% annualized returns. However, the firm's reliance on insurance-derived permanent capital also raises systemic risk flags, particularly if the economy turns. As the market continues to navigate the complexities of AI-driven disruption and credit market volatility, Apollo's bearish software view will be closely watched by investors and industry experts alike.

The estimated value of Apollo's bets against corporate debt is less than $7 billion, representing a tiny slice of the firm's $700 billion credit assets. While the impact on Apollo's overall portfolio performance is expected to be negligible, the firm's broader credit platform continues to grow, with fee-related earnings up 5% year-over-year and assets under management reaching $785 billion in Q1 2025.

**In conclusion**, Apollo's bearish software view is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that reflects the firm's confidence in its ability to navigate the complexities of the tech industry and credit markets. As the market continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether Apollo's strategy will pay off, but one thing is certain – the firm's bold move has sparked a crucial debate about the role of private equity in shaping the future of the tech industry.
