**Apollo Global Management has launched a $1.2 billion credit fund that is deliberately shorting high‑yield corporate debt issued by software companies, signalling a starkly bearish view of the sector’s balance‑sheet health as interest rates stay elevated.**  

## The Bet Explained  

Apollo’s new “Software Credit Short” strategy, unveiled in January 2024, uses a mix of credit‑default swaps, outright bond short sales and leveraged loan positions to profit from a potential decline in the value of software‑sector debt. The fund’s prospectus cites three core concerns:  

* **Leverage:** Average debt‑to‑EBITDA for listed software firms has risen to **5.5 ×**, the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis and well above the historical software median of **3.5 ×** (S&P Global, Q3 2023).  
* **Interest‑coverage:** The sector’s median interest‑coverage ratio slipped to **2.1 ×**, compared with **3.4 ×** in 2020, indicating tighter cash‑flow buffers.  
* **Issuance surge:** High‑yield bonds from software companies totalled **$30 bn** in 2023, a **30 %** year‑on‑year increase and **22 %** of all high‑yield issuance, up from **15 %** in 2020 (Bloomberg).  

Apollo’s team, led by credit veteran Michael J. McCarthy, expects default rates in the software high‑yield market to climb from the current **0.5 %** to **2 %** by the end of 2024, a level that would trigger significant price corrections.

## Targets and Positioning  

The fund’s short positions concentrate on firms that issued debt in the past 12 months with coupons above **7 %** and leverage above the sector median. Notable names include:

| Company | Issue Size (2023) | Coupon | Debt/EBITDA |
|---------|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| Elastic NV | $1.1 bn | 8.3 % | 6.2 × |
| Coupa Software | $750 m | 7.9 % | 5.8 × |
| BlackLine Inc. | $600 m | 7.5 % | 5.4 × |
| Alteryx Inc. | $500 m | 8.0 % | 5.6 × |

Apollo’s filing indicates that short exposure to these issues represents roughly **15 %** of the fund’s net asset value, with the remainder allocated to defensive credit and cash to manage liquidity risk.

## Market Reaction  

Since the announcement, software high‑yield spreads have widened by an average of **45 basis points**, the steepest move in the sector since the 2022 rate‑hike cycle (Reuters, 2 Feb 2024). Analysts at Moody’s have downgraded the sector outlook from “stable” to “negative”, citing “persistent funding pressure” and “valuation compression”.  

Conversely, equity investors remain more optimistic; the S&P 500 software index has risen **12 %** year‑to‑date, underscoring the divergence between cash‑flow‑driven credit metrics and growth‑oriented stock valuations.

## Outlook  

Apollo’s bearish stance is a clear signal that credit markets are beginning to price in the risk of a software‑debt correction. If the Federal Reserve keeps the policy rate near **5.25 %** through 2024, the cost of servicing high‑coupon bonds will remain onerous, potentially forcing restructurings or covenant breaches.  

For investors, the key takeaway is heightened vigilance on leverage ratios and interest‑coverage metrics when assessing software issuers. Apollo’s fund, while still nascent, may become a bellwether for broader credit‑market sentiment toward the once‑invincible software sector.
