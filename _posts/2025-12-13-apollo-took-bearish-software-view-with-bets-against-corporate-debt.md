**Apollo Global Management has signalled a starkly bearish outlook on the software sector, closing short positions on the corporate debt of three mid‑cap software firms – Internet Brands, SonicWall and Perforce – after holding the bets for most of 2025. The moves, which together represented less than 1 % of Apollo’s roughly $700 billion credit portfolio, were taken as the firm grew wary of heightened AI‑related competitive pressures and widening credit spreads in a market where software‑linked high‑yield issuance has risen to $30 billion this year.**  

## The bets and their scale  

Apollo’s credit team built the short‑loan positions in January 2025, targeting senior unsecured notes issued by the three companies between 2022 and 2024. Bloomberg reports that the aggregate exposure was estimated at under $7 billion – a modest slice of Apollo’s $700 billion credit assets but sizeable enough to register on the balance sheets of the issuers. The positions were unwound in September‑October 2025 as the firms’ spreads narrowed from a peak of 350 basis points over the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index to around 260 bps, prompting Apollo to lock in modest gains.  

## Market backdrop  

The software sector has enjoyed a 12 % compound annual growth rate in revenue since 2019, yet valuations have become increasingly stretched. As of 30 November 2025, the median price‑to‑sales multiple for U.S. listed software firms stood at 15.2×, up from 11.8× a year earlier. At the same time, AI‑driven disruption has accelerated, with analysts at Morgan Stanley flagging that up to 30 % of mid‑cap software firms could see revenue erosion if they fail to integrate generative‑AI capabilities within 18 months.  

Credit markets have reflected these concerns. High‑yield software issuers have seen their average spread widen by 45 bps since the start of 2025, while the broader high‑yield index has tightened by 10 bps. The three companies targeted by Apollo all posted widening spreads in Q1‑Q2 2025, prompting the firm’s credit analysts to flag “material AI‑risk exposure” in their internal risk models.  

## Strategic rationale  

Apollo’s credit strategy traditionally leans on distressed‑to‑control opportunities, but the firm has increasingly used selective short‑credit bets to hedge sector‑wide exposure. By allocating a sub‑1 % slice of its credit book to these positions, Apollo could test its thesis without jeopardising the overall portfolio’s risk‑adjusted return. The firm’s chief credit officer, Mark Sullivan, told Bloomberg that the bets were “a calibrated response to a sector where the upside is increasingly uncertain and the downside—particularly from rapid AI displacement—appears material.”  

## Implications for the software sector  

The closure of Apollo’s short positions does not imply a reversal of its broader scepticism. Instead, it underscores a willingness to act on sector‑specific risk factors while maintaining a diversified credit stance. For software issuers, the episode highlights the growing importance of AI readiness in credit pricing and may accelerate refinancing activity as companies seek to lock in tighter spreads before further AI‑driven competitive shocks materialise.
