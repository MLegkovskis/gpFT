The Merz-led coalition is intensifying its scrutiny of several major arms-procurement deals, including the Stark UAV programme and F-35A fighter-jet purchase. The review aims to ensure value-for-money and compliance with Germany's export-control rules. The coalition plans to re-allocate up to 1% of the defence budget, roughly €480 million, to cover any cost overruns and fund the expanded audit apparatus. The scrutiny is part of the government's broader defence strategy, which includes increasing defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2030. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has emphasized the need for tighter export controls, stating that export licences must be compatible with Germany's human-rights standards.
