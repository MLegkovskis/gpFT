**The resurgence of what analysts are dubbing “resource imperialism” – the strategic seizure and control of minerals, energy and rare earths by powerful states and corporations – is reshaping the architecture of global trade and threatening economic stability. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) have sounded a unified alarm: without robust trade‑rule enforcement, the scramble for resources could translate into tariff wars, volatile commodity‑price shocks and a sharp contraction in merchandise trade, especially for export‑dependent economies such as those of North America.** 

The IMF’s latest factsheet underscores the growing complexity of the trade environment. Its “Tariff Tracker”, now monitoring roughly 7 000 tariff actions as of May 13 2025, reflects a surge in protectionist measures that often follow abrupt swings in commodity prices. By linking its data‑gathering to a five‑year macro‑economic‑trade outlook covering 2024‑2029, the Fund signals that commodity‑driven volatility is no longer a peripheral concern but a central variable in global growth forecasts. The IMF’s explicit endorsement of the WTO – “strongly supports the role of the World Trade Organization … in upholding trade rules and settling trade disputes” – reveals a strategic partnership aimed at cushioning economies from the destabilising effects of resource‑centric power plays. 

The WTO’s own December 1 2023 press release paints a bleak picture for the near‑term trade landscape. Its baseline projection anticipates a 0.2 % decline in global merchandise trade for 2025; however, if trade tensions intensify – a plausible scenario given the aggressive acquisition of strategic minerals by state‑backed entities – the drop could deepen to 1.5 %. The impact would be uneven: North‑American exports are slated to shrink by 12.6 % in the same year, a contraction that would reverberate through supply chains and labour markets across the continent. WTO Director‑General’s warning that “every open economy that relies on trade is going to get squeezed, and on top of that you will have negative confidence effects” captures the psychological dimension of the crisis, where uncertainty alone can depress investment and consumption. 

Industry leaders echo these institutional concerns. Mining conglomerates and energy firms have warned that the race to secure deposits in Africa, South America and the Arctic is prompting a new wave of bilateral and multilateral disputes. Governments, meanwhile, are increasingly leveraging export controls and investment screening mechanisms to protect domestic supply chains, further complicating the trade matrix. The convergence of state‑driven resource grabs and corporate lobbying creates a feedback loop: heightened competition fuels protectionist tariffs, which in turn amplify commodity‑price volatility, eroding the predictability that global markets rely upon. 

For policymakers, the path forward hinges on reinforcing the WTO’s dispute‑settlement system and expanding the IMF’s analytical toolkit. By integrating tariff data with real‑time commodity price indices, the IMF can provide early warnings of emerging shocks, allowing governments to pre‑emptively coordinate responses. Simultaneously, a revitalised WTO, equipped to adjudicate disputes over resource‑related trade measures, would restore confidence among exporters and importers alike. 

In sum, the new era of resource imperialism is not merely a geopolitical footnote; it is a structural challenge to the liberal trading order. Without coordinated action from the IMF, WTO and industry stakeholders, the world risks sliding into a fragmented trade environment where resource scarcity fuels protectionism, and the resulting economic turbulence could undermine growth trajectories for years to come.
