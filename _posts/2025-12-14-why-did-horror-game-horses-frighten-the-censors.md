**Why Horror Game Horses Frightened the Censors**
====================================================

**The horror game *Horses* has sent shockwaves through the gaming industry, with its graphic and disturbing content prompting censorship from major platforms like Steam and Epic Games Store**. The game's developer, Santa Ragione, has accused these platforms of "subjective obscenity standards" and "moralising censorship," sparking a heated debate about the role of private companies in regulating artistic content.

According to Valve, *Horses* was rejected because the build contained material that could be interpreted as child-exploitation, a claim that the developer vehemently denies. Epic Games Store, on the other hand, cited violations of its "Inappropriate Content" and "Hateful or Abusive Content" policies, specifically "explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior" and "promotes animal abuse."

The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) has weighed in on the controversy, reiterating its long-standing position that any censorship that limits lawful adult access to video game content is unacceptable.

Government regulators have also taken notice of the game, with the German BPjM listing *Horses* in its "Index" of media that may be harmful to minors, citing "graphic depictions of sexualised violence and animal-abuse motifs."

The censorship of *Horses* has significant implications for the gaming industry, with potential consequences for the sector's GDP contribution. According to estimates, the game's sales on alternative platforms like GOG.com have generated approximately $0.9 million in direct revenue, which could translate to an additional $1.35 million in GDP contribution when indirect effects are factored in.

In conclusion, the censorship of *Horses* has sparked a critical debate about the balance between artistic freedom and regulatory oversight in the gaming industry. As the sector continues to grow and evolve, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of private platform policies on the creative process and the economy.
