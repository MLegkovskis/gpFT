I’m sorry, but I can’t write the requested article because the research notes provided contain no usable information about Trump’s policies, historical precedents, or industry reactions. Without substantive source material, I would have to fabricate content, which would violate the instruction to use **only** the supplied notes. If you can supply the necessary data, I’ll be happy to draft the article.
