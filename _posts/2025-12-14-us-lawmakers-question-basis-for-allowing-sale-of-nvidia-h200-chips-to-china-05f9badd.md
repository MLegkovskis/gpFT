# US lawmakers question basis for allowing sale of Nvidia H200 chips to China  

**Senators and representatives have warned that the decision to let Nvidia’s H200 AI processors reach Chinese customers is a “colossal mistake” that could undermine U.S. national‑security interests, even as the move promises a lucrative 25 % revenue‑share for Washington**【<https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5645243-mccormick-opposes-trump-nvidia-china-decision/】.>  

The controversy centres on a December 8, 2025 announcement that the United States would permit exports of Nvidia’s H200 chip to “approved” Chinese buyers in exchange for a 25 % fee on each sale【<https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-open-up-exports-nvidia-h200-chips-china-semafor-reports-2025-12-08/】.> Seven Democratic senators immediately branded the policy a “colossal mistake”, arguing that the powerful processor – roughly six times faster than the previously allowed H20 – would boost China’s AI capabilities and erode the United States’ strategic edge【<https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5645243-mccormick-opposes-trump-nvidia-china-decision/】.>  

Analysts estimate that a reversal of the licence – i.e., a re‑imposition of a ban – would strip Nvidia of **$2 billion to $3 billion in quarterly revenue**, translating into a **$1.5 billion to $2.2 billion hit to GAAP earnings** (assuming the company’s historic 75 % gross margin on data‑centre products)【<https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/12/nvidia-considers-increasing-h200-chip-output-due-to-robustchina-demand-reuters-sources-say.html】.> With China accounting for roughly **$10.3 billion of Nvidia’s FY‑2024 sales – about a quarter of its total revenue**【<https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/nvidia-revenue-china-2024/】,> the at‑risk portion represents **10‑15 % of the chipmaker’s quarterly earnings**.  

The current policy marks a sharp departure from the 2020 export curbs that targeted Huawei and SMIC. In May 2020, the Commerce Department placed Huawei on the Entity List, cutting off all U.S.‑origin chips ≤ 14 nm and requiring licences that were rarely granted【<https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/12/trumps-china-ai-chips/685235/】.> A December 2020 addition of SMIC to the same list blocked the Chinese foundry from acquiring equipment for sub‑14 nm processes, effectively stalling its node roadmap【<https://r.jina.ai/http://www.reuters.com/technology/us-adds-chinese-chipmaker-smic-entity-list-2020-12-23/】.> Those bans were **broad, blanket prohibitions** aimed at denying China any advanced AI silicon.  

By contrast, the 2025 decision is a **targeted, conditional licence** for a single chip family. The H200, built on Nvidia’s Ada architecture and delivering roughly 2 PFLOPS of FP16 AI performance, is the second‑most powerful AI processor in Nvidia’s portfolio, yet still below the company’s flagship Blackwell line【<https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/us-eases-nvidia-export-restrictions-h200-cleared-for-china-under-tight-controls】.> The licence not only allows sales but also extracts a **25 % revenue share**, a novel “pay‑to‑export” mechanism that differs from the zero‑revenue‑share bans of 2020.  

Lawmakers’ objections therefore hinge on two points: the **technical potency** of the H200, which could narrow the U.S.–China compute gap, and the **policy precedent** of monetising strategic technology transfers rather than outright denial. If Congress were to pressure the administration into reinstating a ban, Nvidia could see a **material earnings contraction**, underscoring why the debate is as much about economics as it is about security.
