**US lawmakers slam the decision to let Nvidia ship H200 AI chips to China, warning it jeopardises America’s strategic edge and could fuel a military AI surge in Beijing.** Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the move a “reckless gamble” that “threatens our national security and undermines the United States’ lead in artificial intelligence.” Representative Michael McCaul, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, warned that the export could give the People’s Liberation Army “a quantum leap in AI‑driven weapons and surveillance capabilities.” Both men argue that the 25 % revenue‑share fee imposed on any H200 sale does little to offset the core risk of handing advanced compute to a potential adversary.

The H200, Nvidia’s second‑most powerful AI processor, delivers roughly twice the compute power of the previously permitted H20 chip and is capable of training large‑language models at a scale that could be repurposed for autonomous weapons or sophisticated intelligence‑gathering systems. The administration’s decision, announced by President Donald Trump on 8 December 2025, allows the chip to be shipped to “approved” Chinese customers, with the U.S. Treasury receiving a 25 % cut of each sale. Seven Democratic senators, including Schumer, Elizabeth Warren and Maria Cantwell, have written to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo demanding a full review, describing the chips as “vastly more capable than anything China can make.”

Beyond the security alarm, the financial stakes are considerable. Analysts at AINvest estimate that H200 exports could inject $25‑$30 billion into Nvidia’s annual revenue, translating into a quarterly boost of $6.25‑$7.5 billion. After the 25 % government share, Nvidia would retain $4.69‑$5.63 billion per quarter. With the company’s FY 2025 Q3 net margin of roughly 65 %, the incremental net income would sit between $3.05 billion and $3.66 billion, or about $0.20 per share on a 16.5 billion‑share base. That represents a 27‑33 % lift over the $23 billion quarterly revenue reported for the July 2025 quarter – a material, though not dominant, uplift.

The current export regime marks a sharp departure from the broader trade‑negotiation stance of the Trump administration. Under the “small‑yard, high‑fence” controls introduced on 7 October 2022, only legacy GPUs such as Nvidia’s H100‑class are eligible for export, with the most advanced Blackwell and Rubin families blocked outright. Licences are granted case‑by‑case, and every unit must be routed through the United States for inspection and tracked with location‑verification software. By contrast, the Trump‑era approach treated chip sales as a bargaining chip: in July 2025 the administration authorised H20 sales for a 15 % revenue share, and in December 2025 lifted the barrier for the more powerful H200 in exchange for a 25 % cut, with far fewer procedural safeguards.

Lawmakers are now pressing for tighter controls. Schumer and McCaul both demand that any export licence be “tightly controlled” and that the administration provide a transparent, risk‑based review before shipments proceed. Their criticism reflects a broader congressional unease that the revenue‑share model merely monetises a strategic concession without addressing the underlying threat of advanced AI compute falling into the hands of a rival military.

The debate underscores a fundamental tension in U.S. policy: whether to prioritise short‑term economic gains and diplomatic leverage, or to safeguard the technological lead that underpins national defence. As the H200 rollout looms, the outcome of the congressional push could reshape the balance between commerce and security in the era of AI‑driven warfare.
