**The Central & Eastern European Forum has become the region’s barometer of integration, yet Poland’s “re‑polonisation” drive threatens to fracture the very single market it relies on for growth.**  

The 2025 gathering in Vienna attracted more than 2,000 delegates from 45 countries, underscoring the CEE bloc’s economic clout – a legacy of the post‑communist transition and the 2004‑2007 EU enlargement that brought ten former Warsaw‑Pact states into the Union【CFR – EU Eastern Partnership background】. Yet the forum’s most striking divide emerged from Warsaw, where Prime Minister **Donald Tusk** declared the “era of naïve globalization” over and called for a “re‑polonisation” of the Polish economy, urging a rise in domestic content in public contracts from 30 % to 45 %【YouTube】. The immediate market reaction was stark: state‑controlled energy stocks slid – PGE –6.6 %, Enea –3.5 %, Tauron –8.5 %【Notes from Poland】, signalling investor anxiety over potential cost‑inflation and reduced cross‑border competition.

By contrast, former Polish premier **Mateusz Morawiecki** used his Budapest plenary to stress that Poland’s growth remains “fuelled by EU integration”, pointing to €120 bn of annual exports to the EU27 and €2.3 bn of EU‑financed technology‑transfer programmes that have helped keep unemployment at 3.1 % and real‑wage growth at 5.2 % YoY【Gov.pl】. His message reinforced the consensus that deeper integration continues to deliver tangible macro‑economic benefits.

Hungary’s voice was more nuanced. Finance Minister **Mihály Varga** warned that over‑reliance on EU structural funds could jeopardise fiscal sustainability, proposing a €4 bn Central‑East European Investment Fund to finance cross‑border infrastructure without direct EU budget allocations【Reuters (12 May 2025)】. President **Katalin Novák** echoed a “de‑politicised economic integration” agenda, citing a 7 % YoY rise in services trade to €22 bn among CEE states【Hungarian Presidency】. Both proposals aim to preserve integration while reducing dependence on Brussels‑directed funding.

Observer **Mark Rutte**, former Dutch prime minister, praised the regional push for deeper ties but warned that Poland’s protectionist tilt could fragment the single market, potentially shaving €150 bn off the EU‑wide €15 trn single‑market GDP if intra‑EU trade fell by just 1 %【FT (20 Apr 2025)】. His caution highlights the macro‑economic stakes of divergent national policies.

The forum’s historical roots trace back to the **Central European Initiative** founded in 1989 after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a direct response to the collapse of communism【CEI – history】. The modern CEE Forum, first convened in 2009 in Bratislava, has grown into the largest global gathering on CEE capital‑market development, with the 2024 edition described as “the biggest CEE Forum on record in its 29th year”【FT Live – 2024 record】 and the 2025 event drawing over 2,000 participants【Raiffeisen – 2025 Forum recap】. Its agenda mirrors EU programmes such as the Savings & Investments Union, cementing its role as a de‑facto EU‑CEE platform【European Commission – SIU Forum 2025】.

Looking ahead, the European Central Bank’s September 2025 staff projections anticipate a modest **0.2 %–0.3 % q/q real GDP expansion for the CEE bloc in Q4 2025**, translating to an annualised 2.5 %–3.0 % YoY gain【ECB staff macroeconomic projections】. This modest rebound follows a strong Q3 performance of 4.0 % YoY【ING – CEE diverging growth】 and is underpinned by German fiscal stimulus and defence‑related spending【ECB staff macroeconomic projections】.

**Bottom line:** While the Central & Eastern European Forum reaffirms the region’s deep‑seated ties to the EU and the post‑communist transformation, Poland’s nationalist “re‑polonisation” agenda introduces a friction point that could undermine the single market’s cohesion—a risk echoed by Hungary’s cautious proposals and Rutte’s warning. The economic stakes are clear: even a small dip in intra‑EU trade could erase hundreds of billions of euros in value, while the projected modest Q4 growth offers only a tentative cushion.
