**The Central & Eastern European Forum in Vienna underscored a cautiously optimistic outlook for the region, with senior policymakers and investors hailing new financing pipelines, AI‑driven analytics and a €500 million reconstruction package for Ukraine as signals of renewed momentum.** Over 2 000 delegates from 45 countries gathered at the Hilton Vienna on 14‑15 January, while a post‑day reception attracted roughly 500 additional participants, reflecting the event’s status as the premier meeting point for CEE finance after three decades of growth.

Key speakers painted a picture of resilience. Valerie Brunner of Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) warned that the energy transition will “increase lending demand”, while IMF’s Geoff Gottlieb praised the region’s “very good shape” and readiness to expand credit. Charlotte Ruhe of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) reminded attendees that EU enlargement remains a top priority for Brussels, and Debora Revoltella of the European Investment Bank (EIB) highlighted the “resilience of CEE economies despite geopolitical tensions”. Banking executives echoed these sentiments: Łukasz Januszewski (RBI) stressed digitalisation as essential for customer engagement and noted the collaborative potential of neo‑banks and fintechs, and Stefan Dörfler of Erste Group pointed to country‑specific industry strengths as the new engine of local business momentum.

The forum’s most tangible initiatives were policy‑driven. A reconstruction financing plan for Ukraine, estimated at €500 million, was unveiled in Panel VI, while NextGeneration EU funds were earmarked for renewable‑energy and digital‑transformation projects across the region. Perhaps the most striking innovation came from RBI’s GenAI‑based “central‑bank sentiment indicator”, which can deliver analysis within 30 minutes of a statement release. Vanguard’s co‑head of emerging‑market fixed income hailed the tool as “a powerful early‑warning risk‑assessment instrument”, whereas National Bank of Hungary Deputy Governor Virág showcased AI use‑cases ranging from outlier detection to alternative‑data development for monetary‑policy support.

Investor sentiment was broadly upbeat but not without caution. While Vanguard’s representative praised AI‑driven analytics, a chorus of investors expressed “lack of consensus” on scaling such tools, reflecting divergent views on the depth of GenAI integration into investment processes. Nonetheless, the overall panel consensus dismissed the notion of a “subdued sentiment toward the European economy” as overstated, arguing there is “good reason to be optimistic about the year ahead”.

The forum’s relevance is amplified by its historic role in the region’s EU integration. For 31 years the CEE Forum has served as the definitive gathering point for governments, markets and investors, evolving in parallel with the EU’s enlargement waves of 2004, 2007 and 2013. The EU now accounts for 71 % of CEE goods trade (€1.2 trillion in 2022) and has channeled roughly €300 billion in Cohesion and Structural Funds since 2004, underpinning infrastructure, SME development and the green transition. By convening EU Commission officials alongside national finance ministries and private capital, the forum operationalises the legal frameworks first set out in the 1998 Association Agreements and translates them into concrete financing, regulatory alignment and market‑building actions.

Looking ahead, growth projections remain modest but positive. The wiiw autumn forecast projects an average annual growth of 2.6 % for CEE economies in 2026, which translates to an implied quarterly pace of about 0.6‑0.7 % for Q1 2026. Mastercard’s Economics Institute notes a “positive but modest near‑term trend”, while euro‑area data show a 0.10 % quarterly increase at the end of 2025, underscoring that the region is expected to outpace the broader euro area’s sluggish recovery.

In sum, the Central & Eastern European Forum has reaffirmed the region’s trajectory toward deeper EU integration, greener finance and digital innovation. With strong institutional backing, a clear policy‑driven financing agenda and a cautiously bullish growth outlook, CEE markets appear poised to translate optimism into tangible economic gains in the months ahead.
