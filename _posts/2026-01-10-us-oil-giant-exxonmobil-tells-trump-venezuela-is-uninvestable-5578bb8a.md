**ExxonMobil’s blunt verdict that Venezuela remains “uninvestable” has forced the Trump administration to tread carefully, as the president’s ambitious $100 billion oil‑rebuilding plan meets a wall of legal and commercial hurdles.** In a high‑profile White‑House gathering on 9 January, Exxon’s chief executive Darren Woods warned that without sweeping reforms to Venezuela’s hydrocarbon law, durable investment protections and a reliable legal framework, any renewed U.S. involvement would be untenable. President Donald Trump, laughing off the assessment, promised to “help make those changes” but offered no concrete policy shift, leaving the oil majors divided between caution and optimism.

The East‑Room meeting, convened by Trump, brought together 17 senior executives from the sector, underscoring the administration’s desire to marshal private capital for the country’s crumbling oil infrastructure. Woods’ remarks were unequivocal: “If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela, it’s uninvestable.” He added that “significant changes have to be made to those commercial frameworks, the legal system, there has to be durable investment protections, and there has to be a change to the hydrocarbon laws in the country.” The Exxon statement released on 10 January reiterated these conditions, signalling that a third re‑entry into Venezuela would hinge on a “significant” overhaul of the legal environment.

Trump’s response was markedly different in tone. He dismissed the “write‑off” as a matter of past losses, insisting that “you’ll get a lot of your money back” and that the administration would not dwell on assets seized by the Maduro regime. While reaffirming the $100 billion target for rebuilding Venezuela’s oil sector, he stopped short of outlining specific diplomatic or regulatory steps, leaving industry leaders to interpret the president’s vague commitment.

Other U.S. oil firms voiced a mixture of enthusiasm and restraint. Harold Hamm, chairman and CEO of Continental Resources and a known Trump ally, described Venezuela as “a very exciting country” with “a lot of reserves,” yet he echoed Woods’s call for a secure investment climate, hinting at a “team on the ground” once conditions improve. Chevron, the sole U.S. operator still active in the country, adopted a cautiously bullish stance, stating that it “needs the same legal and commercial guarantees that Exxon described” before expanding its footprint. ConocoPhillips, through CEO Ryan Lance, expressed appreciation for the opportunity to discuss “preparing Venezuela to be investment‑ready,” but again stopped short of committing capital, emphasizing the need for a clear framework.

The divergent reactions point to a tentative policy shift. Trump’s public pledge to assist in “making those changes” suggests the administration may consider diplomatic pressure on Caracas to amend its hydrocarbon law or to provide U.S.‑backed investment guarantees. The very act of assembling senior executives signals a coordinated effort to align industry expectations with government objectives—a departure from the more hands‑off approach of previous administrations. Yet, the absence of any immediate financial pledges from the majors indicates that the proposed reforms remain speculative.

In sum, the meeting has produced the first concerted U.S. government‑industry push to revive Venezuelan oil production, but concrete action is still pending. ExxonMobil’s categorical “uninvestable” label sets a high bar for any policy maneuver, while Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Continental Resources signal conditional interest, awaiting the legal certainty they deem essential. Whether Trump’s overtures will translate into the durable investment protections required remains the pivotal question for a sector eager to tap Venezuela’s vast reserves.
