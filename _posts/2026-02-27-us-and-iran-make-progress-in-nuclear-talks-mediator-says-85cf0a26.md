### US and Iran Make Progress in Nuclear Talks
The US and Iran have made significant progress in their nuclear talks, according to a mediator. Iran has offered to send half of its most highly enriched uranium abroad and dilute the remainder, while the US has offered phased sanctions relief and recognition of Iran's right to peaceful nuclear enrichment.

The talks have been ongoing, with both sides making concessions. Iran has agreed to limit its enrichment to 20% or lower and reduce its enriched-uranium stockpile. The US has demanded limits on Iran's enrichment and called for the temporary suspension of enrichment and the dismantling of key sites.

Despite the progress, there is still no final deal. The mediator described the talks as showing 'significant progress,' but noted that there are still differences between the two sides. The US has set a deadline for a deal, threatening 'really bad things' if no agreement is reached.

### Key Concessions
* Iran will send half of its most highly enriched uranium abroad and dilute the remainder.
* The US will offer phased sanctions relief and recognition of Iran's right to peaceful nuclear enrichment.
* Iran will limit its enrichment to 20% or lower and reduce its enriched-uranium stockpile.
