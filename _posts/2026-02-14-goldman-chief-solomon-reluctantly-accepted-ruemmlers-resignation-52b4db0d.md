### Goldman Sachs' Stock Price Reaction to Ruemmler's Resignation
The announcement of Kathryn Ruemmler's resignation as Goldman Sachs' general counsel led to a sharp, short-lived sell-off, with the stock price dropping 4.24% on the day of the announcement. However, the stock quickly rebounded, gaining 1.59% over the next 5 trading days. This rebound suggests that investors largely priced in the event and view its impact as limited to 'noise' rather than a structural hit to earnings or balance-sheet strength.

### Market Metrics and Valuation
The stock's valuation metrics, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17.64 and the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 4.93, remain near their 5-year and 10-year highs, respectively. The analyst consensus target for the stock is $953.12, with a moderate-buy recommendation score of 2.6. These metrics support the view that the impact of Ruemmler's resignation is contained and short-term.

### Conclusion
The market's reaction to Ruemmler's resignation indicates that investors are treating the event as a reputational risk with limited structural impact on Goldman Sachs' financials. While the stock experienced a short-term decline, its quick rebound and stable valuation metrics suggest that the market views the event as largely contained.
