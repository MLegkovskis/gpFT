**Trump’s renewed “gunboat diplomacy” off Venezuela’s coast is already costing the United States well over $600 million in initial deployment and roughly $2.2 billion since late August, a daily price‑tag of at least $18 million that will add several billions to the federal deficit and could swell to more than $1 trillion if the campaign expands into a decade‑long effort.** 

The operation, dubbed *Operation Southern Spear*, began with the dispatch of a carrier strike group whose upkeep alone runs at about $6.5 million per day. Broader naval, air and land activities in the Caribbean push the total daily outlay to a minimum of $18 million, according to recent assessments. By 4 January 2026 the cumulative cost of these activities, calculated at $18 million for 120 days, reaches approximately $2.16 billion. The initial deployment phase, which included the carrier group and supporting assets, was already estimated at more than $600 million by late October 2025. 

In fiscal terms the impact is modest but not negligible. The Congressional Budget Office places the FY 2025 deficit at $1.66 trillion. Adding the $2.16 billion already spent nudges that figure upward by roughly 0.13 percent, to about $1.662 trillion. Should the operation continue at its current rate for a full year, the annual cost would climb to about $6.6 billion, pushing the FY 2026 deficit to roughly $1.666 trillion – an increase of around 0.4 percent. 

The real fiscal danger lies in the long‑term scenario outlined by analysts: if the United States were to sustain a multi‑year “run‑Venezuela” campaign, total outlays could exceed $1 trillion over ten years. Such a commitment would inflate the deficit by an estimated 60 percent, moving the cumulative shortfall into the $2.6‑$2.7 trillion range. Financing that gap would require additional borrowing, higher interest payments or cuts to other programmes, each with its own political and economic repercussions. 

Strategic commentators note that the daily cost of maintaining a carrier strike group – $6.5 million – is dwarfed by the broader operational expense, underscoring how quickly a limited naval presence can balloon into a substantial fiscal burden. The $600 million initial deployment figure, already a sizable sum for a short‑term show of force, signals Washington’s willingness to commit significant resources to a conflict that, while geographically confined, carries outsized symbolic weight for the Trump administration’s foreign‑policy agenda. 

While the immediate financial impact may appear modest against a trillion‑dollar deficit, the precedent set by this “gunboat diplomacy” could reshape budgetary calculations for future interventions. Policymakers will now have to weigh the strategic benefits of a high‑visibility naval posture against the incremental but persistent drain on the nation’s finances, especially if the operation evolves beyond a limited strike into a protracted engagement.
