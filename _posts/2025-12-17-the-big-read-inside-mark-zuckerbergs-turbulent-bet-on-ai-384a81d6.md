# The Big Read – Inside Mark Zuckerberg’s Turbulent Bet on AI 

**Meta’s AI gamble has ballooned into a multi‑hundred‑billion‑dollar programme that is already reshaping its share price, prompting fierce regulatory scrutiny and a fresh wave of political lobbying.** In 2025 the company announced a single‑year AI spend of roughly $60 billion, lifted the lower end of its capital‑expenditure outlook to $70‑$72 billion, and committed at least $600 billion to AI‑infrastructure through 2028. The most conspicuous deal – a $14.3 billion acquisition of Scale AI – underscores the scale of the push. 

The market’s reaction has been volatile. On the day Meta reported its Q3 2025 earnings, the stock slipped about 5 % as investors questioned the lack of immediate revenue upside from the massive outlay. By the end of the following month the share price had recovered to a modest net gain of roughly 2 %, closing at $1,235 against $1,210 a month earlier. Year‑to‑date, Meta’s shares are up 8 % as of mid‑December, still lagging the Nasdaq’s 22 % rise. The mixed analyst sentiment reflects a tension between the belief that the AI spend is “necessary for long‑term growth” and fears of an “AI bubble” that could weigh on valuation. 

Beyond the balance sheet, Meta’s AI ambitions are drawing sharp criticism from experts and regulators alike. DigitalDefynd warned that the company’s models, trained on data spanning from 2007 to 2025, risk amplifying societal bias in content moderation, facial‑recognition and recommendation systems. The EU AI Act, effective August 2025, now obliges high‑risk systems to undergo bias‑impact assessments, and regulators have flagged Meta’s Llama‑4 training data as a potential source of systemic prejudice. 

Privacy and cybersecurity concerns have also surfaced. A LinkedIn post by DCInfoTech in December 2025 highlighted deep‑fake chatbots that could impersonate celebrities and minors, exposing sensitive data despite internal policies. The U.S. FTC’s 2024 “AI‑Safe” guidance, reinforced in October 2024, demands pre‑deployment security testing and transparent data‑use disclosures for generative AI services – a hurdle Meta must clear as it rolls out the Meta AI app (launched April 2025) and the AI‑driven video feed “Vibes” (rolled out July 2025). 

Regulatory pressure is intensifying on multiple fronts. The EU’s GPAI Code, adopted in June 2025, requires full model‑weight and dataset disclosure for any claim of open‑source status. Meta’s refusal to comply in July 2025 sparked a compliance dispute that may reshape the definition of openness for all large AI providers. In the United States, California’s AI Transparency Act (SB 1234) cites Meta’s lobbying as a case study, while the pending AI Safety Act – slated for a Senate hearing on 15 February 2025 – is expected to embed Meta‑specific provisions on data provenance and model‑risk reporting. 

Meta’s political influence is equally pronounced. The company’s METAC political action committee, formed in 2024, has already poured roughly $30 million into the 2025‑2026 election cycle, targeting state‑level AI legislation. This lobbying effort is reflected in draft language of California’s AI Transparency Act, suggesting future statutes may require explicit corporate‑influence disclosures. 

Finally, Meta’s own risk‑assessment initiatives are feeding back into policy design. The “Open Loop” pilot, whose first results were released in October 2025, is being used as a reference model in the EU’s proposed AI‑Risk‑Assessment Directive. If adopted, the framework could set a new baseline for mandatory transparency, bias testing and audit trails across the sector. 

In sum, Zuckerberg’s AI crusade is a high‑stakes gamble that blends unprecedented capital deployment with a growing chorus of regulatory and societal concerns. The next few quarters will reveal whether the $600 billion infrastructure commitment translates into sustainable revenue growth or whether the market and lawmakers will force a recalibration of Meta’s AI ambitions.
