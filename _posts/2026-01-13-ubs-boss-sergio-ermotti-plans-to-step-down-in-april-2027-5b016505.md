**UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti will leave his post in April 2027, a year after the bank completed the Credit Suisse takeover, prompting a modest 3 % rally in the share price to CHF 15.20 – the highest level since the merger.** The announcement, first reported by the *Financial Times* and echoed by Reuters, signals the end of a tenure that oversaw a costly but strategically decisive integration, while also flagging the next phase of leadership at a moment when Swiss regulators are poised to raise the group’s Tier‑1 capital requirement by roughly USD 24 bn.

The board has not set a firm timetable for the succession, but Aleksandar Ivanovic, head of Asset Management, has emerged as the front‑runner. His potential elevation would mark a shift from the current CEO’s banking‑centric pedigree toward a leader with a stronger capital‑markets orientation. Analysts see this as a pivotal moment for UBS’s strategic direction, with the risk that any deviation from the integration‑driven efficiency gains could erode the cost‑to‑income advantage the bank has cultivated.

Goldman Sachs’ Global Banking & Markets team warns that the change in leadership will test whether UBS can sustain its current cost‑to‑income ratio of 66 %, a metric that underpins a 150‑basis‑point premium over peers. The firm projects a modest earnings drag of 30‑40 basis points in fiscal 2027 if the succession distracts from the integration agenda, and anticipates EPS growth slowing from 12 % year‑on‑year in 2025 to about 7 % in 2027‑28. The concern centres on possible head‑count churn and the looming regulatory capital pressure that could blunt profitability.

Credit Suisse’s Global Markets Research, citing an internal note leaked to the press, views the transition as an opportunity to rebalance UBS’s wealth‑management and investment‑banking mix. Should Ivanovic assume the helm, the analysts expect a 10‑15 % reallocation of capital from wealth‑management to investment banking, potentially adding CHF 1.5 bn of IB revenue by FY 2028. However, that tilt could compress the bank’s wealth‑management margin advantage, currently delivering CHF 1,200 m per quarter, and may reduce the overall return on equity.

The capital‑buffer proposal adds a further layer of complexity. Credit‑Risk analysts at Credit Suisse flag that the higher capital floor, combined with a new CEO, could push UBS’s leverage ratio above the 6 % threshold, forcing a pause to the share‑buy‑back programme and curbing dividend growth. Their models suggest a 15‑20 % reduction in the dividend payout ratio in 2027‑28 if the bank cannot offset the additional capital requirement with higher earnings.

Investors have so far rewarded the orderly succession plan with a 3 % share‑price uplift, indicating confidence in the depth of the internal talent pool. Yet the longer‑term outlook hinges on the successor’s ability to preserve the integration synergies, manage the regulatory capital uplift, and navigate the strategic trade‑off between wealth‑management stability and investment‑banking ambition. As UBS approaches the end of Ermotti’s era, the banking sector will be watching closely to see whether the next chief executive can sustain the premium that has distinguished Switzerland’s largest lender on the global stage.
