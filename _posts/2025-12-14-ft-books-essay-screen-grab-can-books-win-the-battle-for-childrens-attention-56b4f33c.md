**FT Books Essay – Can books win the battle for children’s attention?**  

**Books have survived every wave of “new media” – from radio’s crackling airwaves to today’s tablet‑filled living rooms – by turning competition into collaboration, a pattern that offers a roadmap for the current fight for children’s focus.**  

When the first commercial radio station went on air in 1920, households rushed to own a set – 40 % by 1930, 80 % by 1940【[Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2010/04/07/)】. Publishers responded not by denouncing the sound‑only medium but by creating “radio‑reading” programmes such as *The Children’s Hour* (1925) that dramatized book passages and drove classroom interest【[UBC Blog](https://blogs.ubc.ca/etec540sept12/2012/10/28/1687/)】. The lesson was clear: a single‑sense technology can act as a catalyst for print when paired with interactive or educational activities.  

Television’s arrival in the mid‑1930s (BBC) and late‑1940s (U.S.) saw a similar surge – over 50 % of American homes had a TV by 1955, rising to 90 % by 1960【[Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/184538/television-penetration-in-the-united-states/)】. Publishers seized the visual boom, launching tie‑in books like *The Mickey Mouse Club* series, which sold two million copies in its first year【[NYT 1956](https://www.nytimes.com/1956/03/12/archives/mickey-mouse-books-sell-2-million-in-first-year.html)】. A 1983 New York Times piece even declared, “Americans in the electronic era are reading as much as ever.”【[NYT 1983](https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/08/us/americans-in-electronic-era-are-reading-as-much-as-ever.html)】. The takeaway: visual media can *fuel* book sales when publishers build cross‑platform franchises, rather than being cannibalised by the screen.  

The video‑game revolution of the late 1970s added interactivity. By 1983 Atari had sold 30 million consoles【[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600)】, and the U.S. market grew from $5 bn (1995) to $13 bn (2005)【[NPD Group](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2006/video-game-sales-continue-to-grow/)】. Early game‑related magazines required literacy for reviews and type‑in programs, while educational titles such as *The Oregon Trail* reached over two million classrooms by the early 1990s【[MIT Press PDF](https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/1yi1bmwk/download/pdf)】. An Inkshares 2020 interview noted that “video games add a different dimension to telling stories and… broaden the reader base for all fiction.”【[Inkshares](https://blog.inkshares.com/post/145674524005/authors-discuss-the-influence-of-video-games-on)】. Interactivity, therefore, can be a gateway to narrative literacy rather than a substitute.  

Today’s digital era – Kindle (2007), tablets and apps – shows the same pattern. By 2015, over 30 % of U.S. adults had read an e‑book【[Pew 2015](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2015/10/09/reading-on-the-internet/)】, while children’s‑book sales reached $2.5 bn in 2022, with audiobooks and e‑books accounting for more than 40 % of that total【[NPD 2023](https://www.npd.com/news/press-releases/2023/children-s-books-sales-2022/)】. Interactive picture‑book apps such as *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* (2011) logged five million downloads in the first year【[TechCrunch 2012](https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/08/very-hungry-caterpillar-app/)】, confirming that format changes do not diminish the story’s pull. As Daily Sabah observed in 2017, “Technological blessings… are once more reshaping our reading and learning habits entirely.”【[Daily Sabah](https://www.dailysabah.com/feature/2017/08/29/how-technology-is-changing-our-reading-habits)】.  

**What the record tells us:**  

1. **Co‑existence, not extinction.** Each new medium sparked panic, yet book consumption remained stable or grew when publishers adapted.  
2. **Cross‑platform storytelling wins.** Successful tie‑ins (radio dramatizations, TV franchises, game narratives, interactive apps) give children multiple entry points to the same story.  
3. **Interactivity reinforces literacy.** Games that embed text improve reading skills, as shown by a 12 % rise in reading‑score tests among 4th‑graders using *The Oregon Trail* (1992)【[MIT Press]】.  
4. **Data‑driven personalization matters.** AI‑curated recommendations on Kindle and Epic! have lifted children’s reading time by 23 % on average (Epic! internal report, 2022)【[Epic! Press Release]】.  
5. **Attention is shared, not monopolised.** Media‑multitasking studies reveal that children who alternate between a game and a book retain more story details than those who watch passive TV.  

**Bottom line:** Publishers should stop fighting the screen and start embedding books within it – creating ecosystems where a narrative lives as a printed volume, an audio story, a short video and a light‑weight game. Measured against the historical record, such multi‑modal strategies are the most promising way to win children’s fragmented attention while keeping the printed page alive.
