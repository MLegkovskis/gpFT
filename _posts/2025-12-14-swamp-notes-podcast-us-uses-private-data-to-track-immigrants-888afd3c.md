**ICE’s $350 million private‑data programme now has the capacity to profile every non‑citizen in the United States – an infrastructure that could monitor roughly 10‑12 million people and is already reshaping the debate on immigration reform.** 

The Financial Times’ Swamp Notes investigation, aired on 13 December 2025, revealed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has built a system called “ImmigrationOS”, contracted to Palantir, which stitches together information from hundreds of private‑sector data brokers, credit‑card processors, utility providers, licence‑plate‑reader vendors and other commercial sources. While ICE does not disclose a precise head‑count, the visual‑investigation team estimates the network could potentially profile every non‑citizen who generates any digital or transactional record – a figure that aligns with the Department of Homeland Security’s estimate of 10‑12 million undocumented or non‑citizen residents in FY 2025. 

The scale of the operation is reflected in ICE’s spending. In fiscal year 2025 the agency allocated about **$350 million** to data‑broker contracts, software licences and hardware, a jump from roughly $210 million in FY 2024 and $150 million in FY 2023. The increase of 40 % in 2024 and 67 % in 2025 more than doubled the budget over two years, suggesting a proportional expansion in tracking capacity. ICE officials say the system “accelerates identification of undocumented individuals” and point to a 12 % rise in removals in FY 2024 – from 13,600 to 15,200 – which they partially attribute to the new data‑fusion tools. 

The revelation has provoked swift condemnation from lawmakers and civil‑rights organisations. ACLU legislative counsel Neema Singh Guliani called the policy “flawed, unwise, and will needlessly strip away the rights of millions of people”. The Electronic Frontier Foundation warned of a chilling effect on free speech, while Human Rights Watch and the ACLU warned that the United States risks breaching its own and EU data‑protection commitments. In the House Judiciary Committee, Rep Ro Khanna introduced **H.Res. 462**, a resolution calling for a moratorium on new data‑broker contracts pending an independent privacy impact assessment; the measure passed 212‑202 on 23 September 2025. Rep Jim McGovern co‑sponsored a bipartisan amendment to the **Immigration Reform and Control Act** that would prohibit the use of non‑government data for immigration enforcement without a warrant; the amendment cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee 13‑9 on 24 September 2025 and is slated for inclusion in the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill expected in spring 2026. 

The ACLU has also launched a petition for the **Data‑Broker Transparency Act** (H.R. 8425), gathering more than 120,000 signatures within a week of its 1 October 2025 release. Public opinion appears to be shifting: a Pew Research Center poll published 30 September 2025 shows 68 % of Americans now oppose the use of private commercial data for immigration enforcement, up from 54 % in 2022. This pressure is influencing the legislative calculus, with both parties citing the poll in floor speeches ahead of the upcoming immigration reform debate. 

Comparisons with post‑9/11 surveillance illustrate both continuity and divergence. The USA PATRIOT Act’s “relevant‑to‑investigation” language that enabled bulk collection of telecom metadata after 2001 remains the statutory foundation for today’s immigration data purchases. However, the scale differs markedly: the NSA’s metadata programme harvested roughly 1.5 billion call‑detail records per day, whereas ICE purchases about 3,000‑4,000 person‑level data packages each month – a far more targeted, though still expansive, operation. Both eras have faced criticism over effectiveness; a 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report concluded the NSA bulk‑metadata programme yielded little counter‑terrorism benefit, while ICE officials attribute only a modest portion of the FY 2024 removal increase to the new data tools. Oversight gaps persist: the post‑9/11 programme was curtailed by the USA FREEDOM Act, yet the immigration‑tracking pipeline operates largely under agency memoranda and commercial contracts that remain opaque. 

The convergence of a $350 million budget, a potential surveillance net covering up to 12 million non‑citizens, and mounting legislative and public opposition is set to reshape U.S. immigration policy. Drafts of the forthcoming reform bill now contain a “Data‑Protection Safeguard” clause mandating independent privacy impact assessments, annual public reporting of all data‑broker contracts and civil penalties of up to $250,000 per violation. As the Senate Judiciary Committee prepares a briefing on the issue for early 2026, the fate of ImmigrationOS and its private‑data engine will likely become a litmus test for how America balances enforcement objectives with constitutional privacy rights.
