**iRobot, the pioneer of household robotics, has filed for Chapter 11 in the U.S. District Court for Delaware, signalling the end of a 35‑year reign that once saw Roomba dominate more than two‑thirds of the global vacuum‑cleaner market. The pre‑packaged restructuring, slated for completion by February 2026, will cancel a $190 million loan, wipe out equity and hand control to Shenzhen‑based PICEA Robotics, while the company’s cash has dwindled to $24.8 million against $352 million owed to its biggest creditor.** 

The filing follows a cascade of setbacks: Amazon’s $1.7 billion acquisition offer in March 2022 collapsed in January 2024 under U.S. and EU antitrust pressure, and revenue in the third quarter of 2025 fell 25 % year‑on‑year to $145.8 million, with U.S. sales down 33 %. A balance‑sheet snapshot at the end of September 2025 showed assets of $481 million against liabilities of $508 million, leaving shareholders with negative equity. The $352 million debt – a $190.7 million loan plus $161.5 million in goods payments to Shenzhen Shanchuan Robotics – triggered the bankruptcy risk.

iRobot’s demise mirrors earlier turbulence in the consumer‑robotics arena. Anki, a maker of toy robots, entered Chapter 11 in April 2019 after burning through roughly $200 million of venture capital, while Rethink Robotics ceased operations in October 2018 when it could not secure further funding amid a shift to cheaper Chinese collaborative robots. All three firms fell victim to intense price competition from Chinese manufacturers, failed strategic exits and capital‑intensive business models that left thin consumer margins exposed.

Sector‑wide data underscores the structural headwinds. Venture‑capital inflows to U.S. and EU consumer‑robotics startups fell from $1.2 billion in 2018 to $620 million in 2024 – a 48 % drop – and average exit valuations slid from $850 million in 2017 to $320 million in 2024. Meanwhile, Chinese‑origin robot‑vacuum shipments surged from 12 % of global units in 2017 to 45 % in 2025, eroding iRobot’s market share from roughly 70 % in 2015 to under 30 % this year.

The market’s reaction has been starkly reflected in iRobot’s share price. At the start of 2025 the stock traded around $8, but by May it had slumped to $2.31, its lowest level since the 2024 decline. A brief rebound to $3.03 in early December was followed by a dip to $1.56 at the end of November, leaving the 52‑week range at $1.40‑$13.06 – a 41 % fall over the past year.

Analysts see the filing as a catalyst for consolidation in the smart‑home ecosystem. IDC predicts the global robot‑vacuum market will reach $9.98 billion by 2031, growing at an 8 % CAGR, and notes that Samsung’s AI‑driven Jet‑Clean 3000 could capture 4 % of the market by 2026. Canalys and Gartner both anticipate that larger players such as Samsung and Dyson will move to acquire technology assets or user‑base contracts, accelerating their own growth. Dyson’s senior VP Emma Hart expects a 3‑5 % uplift in vacuum‑market share, while Samsung’s head of Smart Home Jae‑Hyun Lee foresees a 2‑3 % rise in overall SmartThings adoption as consumers shift away from Roomba.

The bottom line is clear: iRobot’s Chapter 11 filing is the latest high‑profile illustration of how price‑driven competition, aborted M&A rescues and a capital‑heavy model can topple even the most established robotics firms. The vacuum‑cleaner segment will continue to expand, but the vacuum left by iRobot will likely be filled by rivals that can marry low‑cost hardware with sophisticated AI and deep smart‑home integration.
