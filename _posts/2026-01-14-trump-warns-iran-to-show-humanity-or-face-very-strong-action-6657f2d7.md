**Donald Trump’s stark warning that the United States would take “very strong action” if Iran proceeded with executions has set European capitals and oil markets into overdrive. In CBS interviews on 8 January and again on 11 January 2026, the former president threatened a 25 % tariff on any nation trading oil or related products with Tehran, a move that analysts say could shave roughly 15 % off Iranian exports in the first quarter and push Brent crude toward $95 a barrel. The immediacy of the threat prompted the European Union to draft a fresh sanctions package targeting oil exports, banking links and dual‑use technology, while oil desks across London and New York priced in a sharp risk premium.** 

European Union foreign‑policy chiefs convened in Brussels on 12 January and announced that a “new package of sanctions” would be prepared in response to the U.S. warning. Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, warned that continued American pressure could precipitate the collapse of the Iranian regime. The United Kingdom, in a Foreign Office briefing on 13 January, stopped short of committing troops but made clear it “has not ruled out providing military support to any partner that may be called upon to act against Iran.” Spain and Japan issued joint UN‑based statements condemning the crackdown and demanding an immediate halt to executions, while the United Nations Human Rights Council echoed the call for respect for human rights. Qatar, acting through a Doha diplomatic channel, announced intensive mediation efforts to avert escalation, and Israel praised the courage of Iranian demonstrators, welcoming any strong U.S. response. By contrast, Russia, China and Turkey each accused Washington of manufacturing a pretext for military intervention. 

The market reaction was swift and quantifiable. Morgan Stanley’s energy desk projected that the combination of the U.S. threat and a potential 25 % tariff could lift Brent to $95 per barrel by month‑end. Goldman Sachs’ commodities research added a 2 %‑3 % upside for both Brent and WTI over the next fortnight, attributing the lift to a risk premium on possible Iranian oil supply disruptions. Platts analyst John Kelley noted a $3‑$5 per barrel risk premium already embedded in Iranian crude pricing, a premium that would evaporate only if Tehran complied with U.S. demands. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, in its weekly outlook on 14 January, raised its short‑term Brent forecast from $88 to $92 a barrel, citing heightened geopolitical risk after Trump’s latest warning. 

The convergence of diplomatic posturing and market pricing underscores the potency of Trump’s ultimatum. While European allies scramble to align sanctions and signal a willingness to back U.S. measures, they simultaneously pursue mediation to prevent a broader conflict. Oil analysts, meanwhile, treat the threat as a catalyst for price volatility, with the 25 % tariff alone expected to curtail Iranian exports by roughly 15 % in the first quarter, tightening global supply. The death toll from Iran’s crackdown—2,403 protesters killed, according to HRANA—adds a humanitarian dimension that fuels both condemnation and calls for decisive action. 

In sum, Trump’s rhetoric has galvanized a coordinated, albeit uneven, response: the EU moves toward punitive economics, the UK leaves the door ajar for military assistance, and regional powers either endorse or denounce the prospect of force. Simultaneously, energy markets have priced in a tangible upside for crude, reflecting the uncertainty that a “very strong” U.S. response would introduce into an already fragile global oil landscape.
