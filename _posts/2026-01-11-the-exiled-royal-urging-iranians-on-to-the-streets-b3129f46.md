**Reza Pahlavi’s televised appeal on 10 January for Iranians to flood the streets and seize city centres has provoked a swift and stark rebuttal from Tehran’s highest echelons, while Western capitals have issued condemnations of the regime’s crackdown and, in the United States, a direct warning of “very hard” retaliation if lethal force is used.** 

The exiled Crown Prince, broadcasting in Farsi on X, urged citizens to march from 6 p.m. on 10 January and again on 11 January, brandishing flags and national symbols, and called for a nation‑wide strike by workers in transport, oil, gas and energy. His message went beyond a simple protest, declaring that the aim was now to “prepare for seizing the centres of cities and holding them” and to “cut off the financial lifelines” of the Islamic Republic. 

Iran’s leadership responded within hours, framing the mobilisation as a foreign‑engineered plot. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, speaking on state television, accused the demonstrators of being “manipulated by foreign powers” and of “ruining their own streets to please the United States.” The Attorney General, Mohammad Movahedi‑Azad, warned that participants would be tried as *enemies of God* under the death‑penalty provision of the Islamic Penal Code. Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani declared an absolute “no tolerance” for any attempts to destabilise the country, while the Revolutionary Guard Corps pledged to employ “all necessary means” to protect the nation against what it termed sedition and foreign‑instigated chaos. 

The Iranian authorities have already quantified the cost of the unrest. By 11 January the Ministry of Health reported 116 deaths, and the Ministry of Intelligence disclosed that more than 2,600 individuals had been detained. Human Rights Watch and the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency echoed these figures, estimating “dozens of protesters killed; at least 2,000 detained” and confirming the official death toll of 116 with over 2,600 arrests. 

Across the Atlantic, the United States moved from condemnation to a conditional threat. President Donald Trump, in a tweet on 9 January, warned that “if the Iranian regime kills peaceful demonstrators, the United States will hit Iran *very hard*.” The Department of State issued a press release the same day condemning the regime’s lethal force and urging respect for peaceful assembly. Earlier, Pahlavi had directly messaged Trump, pleading for “urgent and immediate” U.S. support and highlighting a “total communications blackout” over the protests. 

The European Union, represented by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, issued a statement on 10 January affirming solidarity with the Iranian people and calling on authorities to respect the right to peaceful assembly. The United Nations Human Rights Office similarly expressed deep concern over reports of excessive force and urged all parties to protect civilians. 

The exchange underscores a widening diplomatic chasm. Tehran’s narrative casts the protests as a foreign‑backed insurgency, justifying harsh legal and security measures, while Western capitals frame the same events as a legitimate popular demand for freedom, condemning the use of lethal force and, in the U.S. case, signalling possible punitive action. The exiled royal’s appeal has thus amplified both internal repression and external pressure, setting the stage for a potentially volatile escalation in the coming days.
