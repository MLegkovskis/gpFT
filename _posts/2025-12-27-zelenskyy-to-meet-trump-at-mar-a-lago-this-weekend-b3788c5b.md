**Zelenskyy to meet Trump at Mar‑a‑Lago this weekend**

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will travel to Mar‑a‑Lago on Sunday 27 December 2025 for a high‑profile meeting with former U.S. President Donald Trump. The agenda, disclosed in a WPBF interview, centres on security guarantees for Kyiv and an “economic agreement” that could unlock a tranche of the $50 billion reconstruction fund embedded in Ukraine’s 20‑point peace plan. While no monetary figure has been announced, analysts agree that the encounter could accelerate the implementation of the plan and lift Ukraine’s real GDP growth from the current 3.5 % to around 5 % by 2027.

Zelenskyy described the 20‑point blueprint as “about 90 % ready” and signalled that the United States would play a pivotal role in both security and economic dimensions. The meeting marks the first public indication that a U.S.–Ukrainian “economic agreement” will be negotiated alongside the peace plan, a development that could release the first $10 billion of reconstruction aid hinted at in separate briefings. If this early tranche materialises, the Atlantic Council’s modelling suggests a 1.2‑percentage‑point boost to annual growth could be realised ahead of schedule, potentially raising 2026 growth to roughly 4.3 %.

Security guarantees are a pre‑condition for foreign direct investment, and the meeting’s outcome could halve the “stability lag” that analysts estimate at twelve months. By shortening this lag to six months, Ukraine could shave an additional 0.3 percentage points off the time needed to reach the 5 % target. In the short term, the World Bank still records a fiscal deficit of about 7 % of GDP for 2025. A U.S. economic pact that includes budgetary support could trim the deficit by half a percentage point, further underpinning growth.

Quantitative forecasts from Reuters and Bloomberg converge on a 5 % growth rate by 2027 if the full $50 billion fund is deployed under a comprehensive peace settlement. The baseline scenario, absent a peace deal, projects growth slipping to 4.0‑4.2 % in 2027 after a modest rise in 2026. By contrast, the accelerated‑implementation scenario envisages 2026 growth at approximately 4.3 % and 2027 at the full 5 % mark, reflecting the combined effect of early reconstruction funding, faster security guarantees and modest fiscal relief.

The bottom‑line estimate therefore positions the Mar‑a‑Lago meeting as a potential catalyst for a 0.8‑percentage‑point uplift in 2026 and a full 1.5‑percentage‑point improvement by 2027. While the exact terms of any economic agreement remain undisclosed, the mere prospect of unlocking even a fraction of the reconstruction fund and securing U.S. security commitments is enough to shift market expectations toward a more optimistic growth trajectory.

Key take‑aways for investors and policymakers are clear: the meeting does not yet carry a concrete monetary commitment, but it signals the first step toward a U.S‑backed economic package that could transform Ukraine’s post‑war recovery. Should the agreement be signed within weeks, Ukraine’s GDP could climb from the current 3.5 % to the mid‑4 % range in 2026 and reach the projected 5 % by 2027, marking a significant uplift over the baseline outlook.
