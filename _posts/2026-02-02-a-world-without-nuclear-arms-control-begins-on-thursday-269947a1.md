### A World Without Nuclear Arms Control Begins on Thursday
The expiration of the New START Treaty on February 5, 2026, marks the end of the last bilateral U.S.–Russia nuclear-arms-control pact. This event creates a legal vacuum that enables the rapid expansion of strategic arsenals, increasing the risk of strategic surprise and miscalculations. The immediate implications of a world without nuclear arms control are far-reaching and have significant consequences for global geopolitical stability.

#### Immediate Implications
The expiration of the New START Treaty removes the only remaining bilateral verification framework between the two largest nuclear powers. This creates a sharp drop in transparency, reviving the risk of strategic surprise that the treaty was designed to curb. The immediate geopolitical risks include an arms-race acceleration, loss of transparency, higher mis-calculation probability, regional ripple effects, and non-proliferation erosion.

#### Quantified Short-Term Changes
Experts project that the U.S. and Russian baseline warhead counts could rise by 10-15% within the first 12 months of no-control, with approximately 150-230 additional warheads each. Missile-launch-vehicle production rates in both countries have already increased by approximately 5% per year since 2022. Risk-assessment models show the probability of a strategic mis-step climbing from approximately 2% under New START to approximately 5% within two years of lapse.

#### Global Non-Proliferation Regime
The dissolution of nuclear-arms-control agreements will transform the relationships among the major nuclear powers from a managed competition to a more fluid, mistrust-laden rivalry. This will likely lead to a weakening of the NPT's disarmament pillar and increase the risk that regional actors will seek their own nuclear capabilities.
