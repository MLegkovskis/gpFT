**A widening rift between Washington and Brussels has erupted into a multi‑front dispute over tariffs, data protection, defence commitments and the role of China, threatening the post‑war transatlantic architecture.**  In the first quarter of 2024 the United States imposed a 25 % duty on European steel and a 10 % duty on aluminium, prompting the EU to retaliate with 10 % tariffs on US pork, whiskey and certain agricultural products.  Simultaneously, the US National Security Strategy released on 9 January signalled a willingness to reassess NATO’s burden‑sharing, while a Republican‑led bill to withdraw America from the alliance entered committee.  The cumulative effect is a “seismic shift”, described by senior diplomats as the most serious strain on the partnership since the early 2000s.

## Trade and Tariff Escalation  

The Biden administration’s Section 301 review concluded that European subsidies to the steel sector distorted the market, leading to the 25 % tariff on hot‑rolled steel and 10 % on aluminium that took effect on 1 March.  The European Commission responded on 15 March with a 10 % duty on US pork, a 12 % duty on bourbon and a 15 % duty on select dairy products, citing “reciprocity” under World Trade Organisation rules.  By the end of March, bilateral trade in goods had fallen 3.2 % year‑on‑year, the steepest decline since 2016.

## Data‑Privacy and Tech Friction  

The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) continues to clash with US corporate practice.  In April, the European Data Protection Board opened a formal investigation into US‑based cloud providers for alleged non‑compliance, a move that US officials warned could “undermine transatlantic digital trade”.  At the same time, the EU’s AI Act, slated for adoption in June, imposes risk‑based licensing on high‑impact AI systems, a requirement US firms argue is “prohibitively costly”.  The resulting regulatory divergence has stalled negotiations on a US‑EU data‑flow agreement that has been in discussion since 2021.

## Defence and NATO Uncertainty  

The National Security Strategy’s Chapter 4, titled “Strategic Competition”, emphasised “greater burden‑sharing” and hinted at a “re‑evaluation of overseas commitments”.  On 22 February, Rep. Thomas Massie (R‑KY) introduced H.R. 8425, a resolution calling for a “strategic withdrawal” from NATO unless member contributions reach 2 % of GDP within five years.  Although the bill faces steep odds, its introduction has prompted NATO Secretary‑General Jens Stoltenberg to convene an emergency summit in Brussels on 5 May, where allies reaffirmed the 2 % target and pledged an additional €30 billion for rapid‑reaction forces.  Nonetheless, EU foreign ministers expressed “deep concern” over the US’s “uncertain commitment” to collective defence.

## The China Factor  

Both sides agree on the need to counter China’s growing influence, yet their approaches diverge.  Washington has accelerated export controls on semiconductor equipment, while the EU has pursued a “strategic autonomy” agenda, seeking to reduce reliance on US technology.  In March, the EU announced a €200 billion “European Chips Act” to double domestic chip production by 2030, a move viewed in Washington as a potential “decoupling” from the US supply chain.

## Prospects for Re‑engagement  

Despite the turbulence, diplomatic channels remain open.  On 12 May, the US State Department and the European External Action Service agreed to launch a “Transatlantic Dialogue on Trade and Technology” with quarterly meetings beginning in September.  Analysts caution that rebuilding trust will require concrete concessions—most notably, a rollback of tariffs and a clear US commitment to NATO’s Article 5 obligations.  Until such steps are taken, the transatlantic partnership will continue to operate under a cloud of uncertainty, with reverberations felt across global markets, security arrangements and the digital economy.
