**Europe Express: Transatlantic Rupture**
Europe's relationship with the US has been reshaped by historical diplomatic tensions, such as those during the Iraq War, which has had a lasting impact on transatlantic relations. As noted by [Stanford FSI](https://fsi.stanford.edu/events/useuropean_relations_after_the_iraq_war), "Many long-time U.S. allies – including, most prominently, France and Germany – were openly hostile to the American action." The Iraq War diplomatic rupture injected quantifiable political, public-opinion, and institutional fissures into transatlantic relations, but the alliance proved resilient enough to rebuild through new NATO capabilities and renewed EU-US dialogues—albeit with a more cautious, less assumption-driven partnership.

The US decision to invade Iraq without a UN mandate created the sharpest diplomatic split since the Cold War, with France and Germany's *no* votes contrasting with the UK's *yes*. This public "Atlantic storm" questioned whether the United States remained a "force for good" and whether Europe remained "relevant" to US interests. According to [e-ir.info](https://www.e-ir.info/2015/08/23/the-iraq-war-as-more-divisive-in-transatlantic-relations-than-the-war-on-terror/), "45% of Europeans sought closer relations with the EU," while 50% wanted closer ties with the US, highlighting a widening gap in public opinion.

The impact of the Iraq War on transatlantic relations has been significant, with the EU launching its own European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) in 2004, later renamed Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). As [PolicyCenter.ma](https://www.policycenter.ma/publications/transatlantic-relations-times-transition) notes, "The Iraq war ruptured the unity of NATO and led European states to reassess their relationships with the United States." The establishment of a NATO Rapid Response Force in October 2004, with a target strength of 20,000 troops by 2005, deployable within 5 days, is a good sign of the alliance's attempt to mend the breach.

The current trade deficit between the EU and US stands at $58 billion, with a goods trade deficit of $235.9 billion and a services trade surplus of $88.6 billion. As [USTR](https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/europe/european-union) notes, "The U.S. goods trade deficit with European Union was $235.9 billion in 2024, a 13.6 percent increase ($28.2 billion) over 2023." The services surplus has more than doubled, rising 20.9% to $88.6 billion, reflecting stronger US export of financial, intellectual-property, and digital services.

In terms of potential implications for European markets and the euro, a trans-Atlantic rupture would weaken the euro, potentially by 1-2%, and raise equity-market volatility across the EU, especially in export-intensive sectors. As [BIS](https://www.bis.org/publ/r_qt0112g.pdf) notes, "The euro fell ≈1% against the dollar after the announcement of a €53 bn Deutsche Telekom-VoiceStream deal (19 July 2000) and lost a total ≈2.9% over the following 10 trading days." Investors have already moved into safe-haven assets, such as US Treasuries, and trimmed euro-denominated positions, while policymakers are preparing defensive trade measures, signaling a possible policy-driven tightening of monetary conditions if the rupture persists.

In conclusion, the Iraq War has had a lasting impact on transatlantic relations, with the EU and US rebuilt their relationship through new NATO capabilities and renewed dialogues. However, the current trade deficit and potential implications for European markets and the euro highlight the need for continued cooperation and dialogue between the two partners.
