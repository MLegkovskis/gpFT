**Europe’s fast‑track to a transatlantic split has accelerated in recent months, as the United States and the European Union clash over tariffs on agricultural and luxury goods, diverge on defence‑spending commitments, and spar over the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act’s green‑technology subsidies. The dispute, now entering its second year, threatens to reshape the partnership from a post‑war alliance into a largely transactional, issue‑by‑issue bargain.**  

## Trade friction deepens  

In March 2024 Washington announced a 25 % anti‑dumping duty on French wine and a 20 % levy on Italian cheese, citing “unfair subsidies” in the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy. The EU retaliated in June 2024 with a 25 % tariff on American bourbon and a 20 % duty on Harley‑Davidson motorcycles – the first such measures since the 1990s. By September 2024, bilateral agricultural trade had fallen 7 % year‑on‑year, while US‑EU industrial exports slipped 4 % (Eurostat, 2024).  

## Defence spending and NATO expectations  

President Joe Biden’s 2024 State of the Union speech urged European allies to meet the NATO target of 2 % of GDP on defence, warning that “the security burden cannot remain one‑sided.” In response, the European Commission’s 2025 defence‑budget review showed that only 12 of the 27 EU members had reached the 2 % threshold, with an average of 1.6 % across the bloc. Germany announced a €7 billion increase in defence outlays for 2025, but the United Kingdom’s 2025 defence review projected a 1.8 % GDP spend, still below the NATO benchmark.  

## Climate policy and the Inflation Reduction Act  

The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted in August 2022, offers up to $369 billion in subsidies for clean‑energy projects, but eligibility is limited to manufacturers that meet “U.S. content” rules. European firms, representing roughly 30 % of global wind‑turbine capacity, have lodged formal complaints with the World Trade Organisation, arguing the rules constitute a de‑facto trade barrier. In February 2025 the European Commission launched a “Green Deal‑to‑IRA” task force, yet negotiations have stalled, with the United States maintaining that the IRA is “a domestic policy matter.”  

## A shift towards a conditional partnership  

Analysts now describe the relationship as “transactional” rather than “strategic.” An Iowa Public Radio interview (8 Dec 2025) with a senior EU defence official highlighted a new “transatlantic bargain” in which Europe must shoulder more of its own security while preserving market access for US firms. A CSIS briefing (Oct 2024) warned that the United States now ranks Europe third in its global priority list, after the Western Hemisphere and China, signalling a willingness to leverage trade and security incentives to extract concessions.  

## Outlook  

If the tariff spiral continues and the IRA dispute remains unresolved, bilateral trade could contract another 3‑5 % by 2026, and NATO cohesion may be tested by divergent defence‑spending trajectories. Both sides have signalled a willingness to negotiate – the EU’s “conditional partnership” paper (June 2025) proposes a joint fund for semiconductor supply‑chain resilience, while Washington has hinted at a limited waiver on IRA content rules for EU wind‑turbine manufacturers. The coming months will determine whether the rupture becomes a permanent fissure or a recalibrated, albeit more conditional, alliance.
