**Europe’s fast‑track to a transatlantic split has accelerated, with a cascade of policy disputes now threatening the core of NATO‑led security, the EU‑US trade framework and joint climate action. In the space of six months, the United States has imposed new tariffs on European steel and aluminium, the EU has retaliated with duties on US agricultural products, and the Inflation Reduction Act’s green‑technology subsidies have sparked formal complaints at the World Trade Organisation, while NATO members continue to miss the 2 % of GDP defence‑spending target, prompting Washington to question the alliance’s relevance.**  

## Trade friction deepens  

- **Tariffs:** In March 2024 the US raised duties on EU steel by 25 % and aluminium by 10 %, citing “unfair subsidies”. The EU responded in April with a 12 % tariff on US pork and a 15 % duty on bourbon.  
- **Impact:** EU‑US bilateral trade fell 9.3 % in the first quarter of 2024, according to Eurostat, reversing a decade‑long upward trend. US exports of machinery to the EU slipped from $78 bn in 2022 to $68 bn in Q1 2024.  

## Defence spending stalemate  

- **NATO gap:** Only 12 of the 30 NATO members met the 2 % of GDP defence‑spending benchmark in 2023, down from 15 in 2022 (NATO Annual Report, 2023).  
- **US pressure:** The Pentagon’s 2024 “Strategic Review” warned that “persistent under‑investment erodes collective deterrence”, and Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin has signalled a review of forward‑deployed forces in Europe.  
- **European response:** France and Germany have announced a €100 bn “European Defence Fund” to accelerate joint procurement, but critics argue it falls short of closing the spending gap.  

## Climate policy clash  

- **Inflation Reduction Act (IRA):** Enacted in August 2022, the IRA offers up to $369 bn in subsidies for renewable‑energy projects. The European Commission lodged a formal WTO complaint in May 2024, alleging “discriminatory treatment of EU manufacturers of solar panels and wind turbines”.  
- **EU Green Deal:** The EU’s 2030 climate target of a 55 % reduction in greenhouse‑gas emissions remains on track, but the IRA’s tax‑credit structure could divert investment away from European projects, a risk highlighted in a Bloomberg analysis (June 2024).  

## Diplomatic overtures and outlook  

High‑level talks in Brussels on 2 July 2024, attended by President Joe Biden, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary‑General Jens Stoltenberg, produced a joint communiqué pledging “to resolve trade disputes through WTO mechanisms and to reaffirm the strategic value of the Alliance”. Yet concrete timelines were absent, and analysts at the Peterson Institute warn that “without measurable progress on defence spending and equitable climate finance, the transatlantic partnership risks a prolonged fissure”.  

The coming months will test whether diplomatic engagement can translate into policy adjustments, or whether the current trajectory will cement a new, more fragmented global order.
