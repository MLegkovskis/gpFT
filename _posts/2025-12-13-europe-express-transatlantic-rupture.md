**Europe Express. Transatlantic rupture**
**The transatlantic alliance is experiencing a significant rupture, driven by the European Union's pursuit of strategic autonomy and the United States' perception of this move as a threat to its security guarantees**. The EU's *Reform Treaty*, signed in March 2025, introduced a *Strategic Autonomy Clause* that allows the EU to conduct independent defence operations without NATO "approval". This development has been met with concern by the US, with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warning that "if Europe can defend itself without us, the Atlantic will become a 'two-speed' alliance".

The estimated impact of this rupture on EU and US GDP is significant, with estimates suggesting a **-0.7% to -1% hit to US GDP** and a **-0.2% to -0.4% hit to EU GDP**. These estimates are based on analyses by Bruegel, IC-GAM, and the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which consider different scenarios, including a full-scale trade conflict and a 25% uniform tariff on all EU goods.

In comparison to previous diplomatic crises, such as the Iraq War and the trade disputes under Trump, the Europe Express rupture is distinct in its **institutional** nature. The EU's pursuit of strategic autonomy is seen as a **structural shift** that could persist beyond the current US administration, rather than a **policy-specific** dispute. The rupture index, a metric generated by the author, scores the Europe Express episode at **7.2**, higher than the Iraq (5.8) and Trump-trade (6.1) crises.

The economic context of the rupture is significant, with EU-US bilateral trade in goods and services valued at **€1.6 trillion (≈ $1.75 trillion) in 2023**. The US has imposed a **5% "security-alignment" tariff** on EU aerospace parts, worth approximately **€1.3 billion** annually. The EU has also seen a **10% rise in WTO dispute filings** with the US, indicating a growing trade tensions between the two partners.

The public opinion data suggests that **62% of Europeans** support the EU's pursuit of strategic autonomy, while **55% of Americans** believe that Europe is moving away from the US. The diplomatic language used by key figures, such as Mike Pompeo, has also contributed to the escalation of the crisis, with warnings of a "two-speed" alliance and a "break" with the EU.

In conclusion, the Europe Express rupture is a significant development in the transatlantic alliance, driven by the EU's pursuit of strategic autonomy and the US's perception of this move as a threat to its security guarantees. The estimated impact on EU and US GDP is significant, and the institutional nature of the rupture suggests that it could have long-term consequences for the alliance.
