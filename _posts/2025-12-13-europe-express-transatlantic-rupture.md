**A widening rift between Washington and Brussels has moved from diplomatic friction to a structural rupture, as disputes over trade tariffs, defence financing and digital regulation converge to threaten the post‑World‑War II transatlantic architecture.**  

## Trade and technology tensions  

The EU‑US Trade and Technology Council (TTC), relaunched in Brussels on 15 June 2021, met its latest ministerial session in Leuven on 4‑5 April 2024. While the agenda included cooperation on semiconductor supply chains and green‑energy imports, the joint communiqué was unusually terse, noting “the need for a balanced approach to non‑market practices” without committing to concrete tariff reductions.  

Bilateral trade in goods and services remains the world’s largest, valued at roughly **$1.1 trillion** in 2023, but the United States has threatened to re‑impose **15 % tariffs on EU steel and aluminium** if European subsidies for renewable‑energy projects are not curtailed. The European Commission, in turn, has signalled a possible **retaliatory levy of up to 10 % on US agricultural exports** should Washington proceed.  

## Defence spending and strategic autonomy  

NATO’s 2 % of GDP defence‑spending target has become a flashpoint. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, European defence budgets have risen by **approximately 30 %**, with Germany earmarking **€100 billion** for new armaments and the United Kingdom pledging **£12 billion** for naval modernisation.  

U.S. officials, citing the 2025 joint “Framework Agreement”, have pressed European allies to lift the ceiling on defence contributions from 2 % to **3‑3.5 % of GDP**. In response, senior EU officials have reiterated the principle of **strategic autonomy**, arguing that reliance on the U.S. nuclear umbrella must be reduced. French defence minister Sébastien Lecornu announced in March 2025 that France is prepared to **extend its nuclear deterrent to other EU states** should Washington withdraw its guarantee.  

## Digital regulation and climate policy  

The EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) and forthcoming AI Act clash with U.S. expectations for a more permissive content‑moderation regime. A bipartisan U.S. Senate committee warned in July 2024 that “non‑compliance could trigger restrictions on American tech firms operating in Europe”.  

Climate policy adds another layer of friction. The EU’s **Fit‑for‑55** package, aiming to cut emissions by 55 % by 2030, includes subsidies for offshore wind that the United States labels as “discriminatory”. In turn, the EU seeks guaranteed imports of **U.S. liquefied natural gas** to replace Russian supplies, a demand that Washington has linked to concessions on digital trade.  

## Outlook  

Analysts at the Brookings Institution and NPR’s foreign‑policy desk describe the emerging “transatlantic bargain” as increasingly **transactional and conditional**. Europe is poised to deepen its own defence industry and digital standards, while the United States is leveraging its market size to extract political concessions.  

If the stalemate persists, the rupture could fragment global supply chains, erode NATO cohesion and force third‑party economies to choose between competing regulatory regimes. A swift diplomatic reset—perhaps through a refreshed TTC agenda that couples concrete tariff cuts with a mutually recognised defence‑financing framework—remains the most plausible path to preserving the transatlantic artery.
