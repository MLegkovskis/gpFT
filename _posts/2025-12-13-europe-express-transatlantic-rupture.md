**A deepening rift between Washington and Brussels has been triggered by renewed US sanctions on firms linked to the stalled Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, reviving a dispute that has already seen sabotage, legal battles and speculation about a post‑war revival.**  

## Sanctions and Diplomatic Fallout  

On 12 May 2025 the United States Treasury announced secondary sanctions on three Russian‑controlled entities still holding stakes in Nord Stream 2, citing “continued support for the Russian war effort”. The measures freeze any US‑linked assets and bar American firms from providing services to the sanctioned parties. Germany’s foreign ministry called the step “unilateral and destabilising”, while the European Commission issued a statement urging “constructive dialogue” to avoid further erosion of trans‑Atlantic trust.  

## European Reaction  

The EU’s Energy Council convened an emergency meeting on 15 May, where member states expressed concern that the sanctions could jeopardise energy security at a time when Europe is still reducing reliance on Russian gas. The council noted that, had it entered service, Nord Stream 2 would have added 20‑30 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas per annum – roughly 12 % of the EU’s 2023 consumption. The European Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy called for a “coordinated European response” and urged the Commission to mediate between Washington and Berlin.  

## Legal and Investigative Developments  

Parallel to the diplomatic row, investigations into the September 2022 explosions that damaged both Nord Stream lines have progressed. German prosecutors announced on 21 August 2025 the extradition of Ukrainian national Serhii Kuznetsov from Italy, following a European arrest warrant issued in March 2025. Kuznetsov is accused of facilitating the placement of explosives, a charge he denies. Denmark and Sweden have concluded their inquiries, each confirming “gross sabotage” but stopping short of naming perpetrators.  

## Economic and Strategic Implications  

The pipeline’s total capacity of 110 bcm per year – double the existing Nord Stream 1 line – remains a focal point in the EU’s long‑term energy strategy. Analysts at the International Energy Agency estimate that a full‑scale restart could lower wholesale gas prices by €2‑3 /MWh in the 2026‑2028 period, assuming geopolitical conditions permit. Conversely, the sanctions risk prompting German energy firms to seek alternative financing, potentially delaying any revival by 12‑18 months.  

## Outlook  

With the United States signalling a willingness to maintain pressure on Russian energy assets, and the EU insisting on a European‑led solution, the trans‑Atlantic relationship faces a test of resilience. The next diplomatic overture is expected at the NATO summit in July 2025, where energy security will sit alongside defence commitments. How the parties reconcile sanctions with the continent’s lingering gas needs will shape not only the fate of Nord Stream 2 but also the broader architecture of Europe‑US cooperation in the post‑war order.
