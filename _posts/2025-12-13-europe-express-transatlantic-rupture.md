**Europe Express: Transatlantic Rupture**
The transatlantic relationship between the EU and the US is facing a significant rupture, with estimated impacts on GDP and trade that could have far-reaching consequences for both economies. According to research by Bruegel, the "no-deal/rupture scenario" could lead to a **-0.7%** decline in US real GDP and a **-0.3%** decline in EU real GDP. This translates to approximately **$0.5 trillion** of lost output in the US and **€0.2 trillion** of lost output in the EU.

The European Commission has downgraded its 2025 GDP growth forecast to **0.9%**, citing US tariffs as a significant factor. The transatlantic economy totals **$8.7 trillion** in combined trade and affiliate activity, making even a modest percentage-point loss a significant blow to both economies. The estimated impact on EU and US GDP is a result of the rupture, which is expected to have a **significant, measurable drag** on both sides of the Atlantic.

In comparison to past diplomatic crises, such as the Iraq War and the Trump-era trade disputes, the current rupture is distinct in its focus on **security-autonomy** and **logistics-infrastructure**. The EU's push for an independent "South-Atlantic" security line and the "Europe Express" rail-and-maritime corridor plan have been met with opposition from the US, which warns that these moves could "undermine NATO cohesion."

The current rupture is still unfolding, but the **July 2025 NATO-EU summit** suggests a potential institutionalization of a more autonomous European security posture while keeping the Atlantic link intact. The EU has already begun to develop new mechanisms, such as the **Anti-Coercion Instrument**, to defend its companies and workers against unfair US tariffs.

According to a Eurobarometer survey, **58%** of EU respondents say "the US is becoming less reliable as a security partner," and **42%** say "Europe should develop its own strategic capabilities." The public-opinion impact of the rupture is significant, with many Europeans questioning the reliability of the US as a security partner.

In conclusion, the transatlantic rupture has significant implications for both the EU and US economies, with estimated impacts on GDP and trade that could have far-reaching consequences. The current rupture is distinct in its focus on security-autonomy and logistics-infrastructure, and the EU's push for an independent "South-Atlantic" security line and the "Europe Express" rail-and-maritime corridor plan have been met with opposition from the US.
