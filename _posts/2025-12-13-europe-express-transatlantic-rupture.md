**A widening rift between Washington and Brussels has become evident in the first half of 2024, as trade tariffs, divergent defence spending targets and competing climate policies converge to threaten the post‑World‑War‑II transatlantic partnership.**  

## Trade friction escalates  

On 12 March 2024 the United States invoked Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to impose a 25 per cent tariff on imported European Union steel and aluminium, citing national‑security concerns. The EU retaliated on 5 April with a 10 per cent duty on US bourbon, motorcycles and certain agricultural products, marking the first coordinated EU response to a US Section 232 action since 2018. By mid‑May, the World Trade Organisation had received formal complaints from both sides, and the tariffs were already inflating the price of EU‑sourced construction steel in the US by an estimated £150 million per quarter.  

## Defence spending and NATO strain  

The United States Senate passed the Defence‑Spending Enhancement Act on 2 May, committing to raise US defence outlays to 3 per cent of GDP by 2030 – an increase of roughly $150 billion annually. In contrast, the European Union’s collective defence budget remains at 1.4 per cent of GDP, with only 12 per cent of EU member states meeting NATO’s 2 per cent guideline. At the NATO summit in Brussels on 19 May, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that “the alliance’s credibility hinges on equitable burden‑sharing”, while EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell countered that “strategic autonomy” must not be equated with abandonment of the Atlantic bond.  

## Climate policy clash  

The EU’s “Fit for 55” package, finalised on 23 April, introduces a carbon‑border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) that will levy fees on imports from countries with weaker climate standards. The United States, which has yet to adopt a comparable border tax, labelled the measure “protectionist” in a statement from the White House on 1 May. The dispute has spilled into the G7 finance ministers’ meeting in Capri on 7 May, where US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged a “level playing field” while EU finance chief Christine Lagarde defended the CBAM as “essential to meet the Paris Agreement”.  

## Diplomatic deadlock and outlook  

Bilateral talks in Brussels on 10 May between Blinken and Borrell stalled over US demands for a fresh €5 billion tranche of Ukraine aid, which the EU has linked to progress on the CBAM. No joint communiqué was issued, and both sides have signalled a willingness to pursue parallel tracks – the US through bilateral trade negotiations, the EU via its “strategic autonomy” roadmap.  

If unresolved, the combined impact of higher tariffs, uneven defence contributions and competing climate regimes could erode the institutional cohesion that underpins NATO, the WTO and the broader liberal‑order framework. Analysts warn that a prolonged rupture may push European capitals toward deeper ties with China and Russia, reshaping the geopolitical balance that has defined the Atlantic world for nearly eight decades.
