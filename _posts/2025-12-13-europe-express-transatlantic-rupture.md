## Europe Express. Transatlantic rupture  

**The European Union’s €1.5 trillion “European Express” high‑speed rail programme, unveiled on 12 May 2024, has collided with a growing US‑EU dispute over the bloc’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), prompting Washington to threaten retaliatory tariffs on European steel and rail components and signalling the sharpest transatlantic strain since the 2019 trade spat over aircraft subsidies.**  

## The European Express plan  

The European Commission’s transport directorate‑general released a detailed roadmap on 12 May, earmarking €1.5 trillion of public and private funding to deliver a continent‑wide high‑speed rail network by 2035. Key targets include:  

- Reducing average inter‑city travel times by 30 % (e.g., Paris‑Berlin from 8 h to under 6 h).  
- Cutting transport‑related CO₂ emissions by 40 % relative to 1990 levels, contributing to the EU’s 55 % emissions‑reduction goal for 2030.  
- Mobilising €300 billion in private capital through the EU’s “InvestEU” scheme and a new “Rail‑Bond” instrument.  

The plan is anchored by three flagship corridors – the “North‑South Axis” (London‑Madrid), the “East‑West Axis” (Warsaw‑Lisbon) and the “Central Axis” (Vienna‑Milan) – each slated for initial service by 2029.  

## US reaction and the CBAM flashpoint  

On 20 May, the US Trade Representative announced a review of EU‑origin steel and aluminium used in rail infrastructure, citing “unfair subsidies” linked to the European Express funding package. The review follows the European Commission’s 1 January 2024 implementation of CBAM, a carbon‑border tax that imposes a levy on imports of steel, cement and aluminium based on their embedded emissions.  

The United States, which has not adopted a comparable border carbon tax, warned that “any unilateral carbon pricing that disadvantages American manufacturers will be met with appropriate countermeasures.” On 2 June, the Department of Commerce lodged a formal complaint at the World Trade Organization, seeking provisional duties of up to 12 % on EU rail‑related steel.  

## Stakes for the transatlantic partnership  

Analysts at the Centre for European Policy Studies estimate that the EU’s rail rollout could generate €200 billion in annual economic output and create 1.2 million jobs across member states. Conversely, the US‑EU tariff dispute threatens to raise the cost of EU‑built rail components by €150 million per kilometre of new track, potentially delaying project milestones.  

The diplomatic fallout extends beyond trade: the European Council’s foreign affairs summit on 8 June recorded a “significant divergence of views” on climate policy, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urging a “level‑playing field” that does not penalise American industry.  

## Outlook and possible resolution  

Both sides have signalled a willingness to negotiate. The EU has offered a limited exemption for rail‑grade steel that meets a “green‑certification” standard, while Washington is considering a reciprocal waiver for EU‑manufactured aircraft components, a sector already under US scrutiny.  

If a compromise is reached before the EU’s 2027 funding tranche, the European Express could proceed on schedule, preserving the bloc’s climate‑driven transport agenda. Failure to bridge the gap, however, risks a prolonged trade war that could erode the transatlantic alliance and undermine global efforts to decarbonise mobility.  

The coming weeks will test whether diplomatic pragmatism can outweigh the competing economic and environmental imperatives that now define the EU‑US relationship.
