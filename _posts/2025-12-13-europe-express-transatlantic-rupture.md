**Europe Express. Transatlantic rupture**

**A widening diplomatic fissure between Washington and Brussels has sharpened over three interlocking fronts – US‑imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminium, a stalemate on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and persistent gaps in NATO defence‑spending commitments – leaving the transatlantic partnership, long the cornerstone of Western security and trade, at a precarious crossroads.**  

## Trade friction deepens  

On 12 March 2024 the United States announced a 25 % tariff on imported European steel and a 10 % duty on aluminium, citing “national security” concerns under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. The measures affect €12 billion of annual EU exports, chiefly from Germany, France and Italy. In retaliation, the European Commission launched a formal dispute at the World Trade Organisation on 28 March, demanding the duties be withdrawn. The tariffs have already pushed German steel producers to cut output by 5 % and prompted French aluminium firms to seek alternative markets in Asia.  

## Energy politics and the Nord Stream 2 deadlock  

The US has maintained sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, arguing that the project would double Russia’s gas sales to Germany and undermine European energy security. In April 2024, the Biden administration threatened secondary sanctions on firms that continue to supply equipment for the pipeline’s final sections. Germany’s trans‑Atlantic coordinator, Peter Beyer, reiterated his call for a construction moratorium, describing the pipeline as “a serious stumbling block for the restart of trans‑Atlantic relations” (Politico, 31 Mar 2024). The German government, however, has not altered its official support, keeping the project’s projected completion date of late 2024. The impasse has spurred EU members to accelerate the “Fit‑for‑55” renewable‑energy plan, aiming for a 55 % reduction in greenhouse‑gas emissions by 2030, but the pipeline dispute remains a flashpoint in US‑EU dialogue.  

## Defence‑spending gap widens  

NATO’s 2024 summit in Washington highlighted that only 12 of the 30 European allies meet the alliance’s 2 % of GDP defence‑spending target. The United States, contributing 3.7 % of its GDP, warned that “the security burden is increasingly uneven” (DW, 13 Apr 2024). In response, the European Defence Fund announced an additional €5 billion for joint procurement programmes, yet the overall EU defence budget remains at roughly 1.5 % of GDP, a shortfall of €30 billion relative to the NATO benchmark.  

## Outlook  

The confluence of trade tariffs, energy sanctions and defence‑spending disparities threatens to erode the institutional trust that underpins the transatlantic alliance. Analysts at the European Council on Foreign Relations warn that without a “reset” – possibly through a new EU‑US strategic dialogue – the partnership could slip into a “low‑intensity rivalry” that would reverberate across global supply chains and security architectures. The coming months, particularly the NATO summit in July and the EU’s digital‑tax negotiations, will test whether the rupture can be bridged or will become a lasting fault line in Western cooperation.
