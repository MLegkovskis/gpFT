### China's High-Speed Rail Network Accelerates World's Largest Human Migration
The world's largest annual human migration, known as the 'Chunyun' Spring Festival travel rush, is being accelerated by China's high-speed rail (HSR) network. With over 9 billion trips expected during the 2026 Spring Festival period, the migration is driven by rural-to-urban labor flow, with migrant workers traveling from rural provinces to coastal megacities for work.

The high-speed rail network has expanded to over 50,000 km, reducing travel time and increasing connectivity between cities. This has made it easier for migrant workers to travel back to their hometowns for the Lunar New Year, and has also stimulated growth in tourism and other businesses in western China.

The HSR network is also having a positive impact on urban planning, with cities rezoning areas around HSR stations for high-density housing, offices, and logistics hubs. Additionally, the network is supporting the development of polycentric city networks, with multiple cities connected by HSR lines.

However, the migration also poses challenges for local governments, including managing the influx of people, providing adequate housing and services, and addressing environmental and energy concerns.
