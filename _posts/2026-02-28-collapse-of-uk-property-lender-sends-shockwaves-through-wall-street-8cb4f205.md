### Collapse of UK Property Lender Sends Shockwaves Through Wall Street
The collapse of Market Financial Solutions, a specialist UK mortgage provider, has sent an immediate shock through Wall Street on 27 Feb 2026. The lender entered administration after Barclays froze its accounts, with Barclays having a £600m exposure to the collapsed lender. 

The immediate market reaction saw Barclays' shares fall 1.1% in London and 1.4% in New York, while Jefferies suffered the sharpest U.S. move at -3.4%. Smaller declines were recorded for Wells Fargo, Santander, Castlelake, and Atlas SP Partners. 

The collapse has raised concerns about the potential ripple effects on the global economy, although the full extent of the impact is still unclear.
