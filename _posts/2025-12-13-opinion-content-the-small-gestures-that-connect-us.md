**The significance of industries focused on social connections and community building cannot be overstated, with approximately 10% to 15% of global GDP attributed to these sectors**. This staggering figure encompasses a range of industries, including social enterprise, travel and tourism, creative industries, and social-media and digital networking platforms. According to the World Economic Forum, the social-enterprise sector alone accounts for around **2% of global GDP**, translating to roughly **$1.5-$2 trillion** in total revenue. 

The travel and tourism industry is another substantial contributor, with the World Bank noting that it accounted for **10% of the global economy** in 2024, contributing **$10.9 trillion** to global GDP. Furthermore, the World Economic Forum projects that travel and tourism will contribute **$16 trillion** to global GDP by 2034, exceeding **11%** of the global economy. The creative industries, which include media, design, advertising, gaming, and cultural events, represent **up to 2-7% of GDP** in mature economies and could account for **10% of global GDP** before 2030, according to the International Finance Corporation.

The economic multiplier of social-media and digital networking platforms, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, is also significant, with the "Information & Communication" sector contributing **approximately 5%** of world GDP in 2022. To derive the overall figure, we add the headline shares of these industries (**2% + 10% + 5% + 5%**) and adjust for overlap, applying a conservative correction of **30-40%**. This results in a plausible range of **10% to 15%** of global GDP being attributed to industries focused on social connections and community building.

As noted by the [World Economic Forum](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_State_of_Social_Enterprise_2024.pdf), "Social enterprise accounts for around **2% of global GDP** … this is greater than the apparel industry and almost twice the size of the advertising industry." The [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/competitiveness/brief/tourism-and-competitiveness) also highlights the significance of tourism, stating that "In 2024, tourism accounted for **10% of the global economy**, contributing **US$10.9 trillion** to global GDP." The [International Finance Corporation](https://www.ifc.org/en/what-we-do/sector-expertise/creative-industries) notes that "Creative Industries could account for **10% of global GDP before 2030**."
