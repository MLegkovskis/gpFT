The relationship between Germany and the US is experiencing a significant downturn, driven by multiple factors. Unequal defense spending, with Germany allocating only 1.38% of its GDP to defense in 2019, has led to accusations of 'free-riding' from the US. The US troop drawdown in Germany, from approximately 34,500 to 25,000 troops, has been interpreted as a signal that the US no longer views Germany as a reliable security partner. Trade friction, including threats of 25% tariffs on German cars, has jeopardized Germany's key export sector and fueled political backlash against Washington. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline dispute has also created tension, with the US imposing sanctions on firms involved in the project and Germany calling the sanctions 'unjustified'. Divergent approaches to global crises, such as the Ukraine war and climate policy, have created a perception that the two allies no longer share strategic priorities. Shifting public opinion in Germany, with only 21% of Germans viewing the US as a partner on free trade, has further strained relations. The erosion of the post-World War 'special relationship' narrative has amplified the perception of a diplomatic rupture.
