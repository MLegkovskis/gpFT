**Trump’s war on ‘woke’ splits the fortunes of US brands** – As former President Donald Trump revives his crusade against “woke” culture, the corporate landscape has fractured. Some CEOs have leaned into patriotic messaging to shield market share, while others have suffered sharp sales drops and share‑price volatility after being singled out in Trump‑fuelled boycotts. The result is a stark divergence in brand performance, with the financial fallout now measurable in earnings, market‑capitalisation and executive sentiment.

The conflict first entered the boardroom in August 2017, when Trump’s remarks after the Charlottesville rally prompted Merck chief Kenneth Frazier to resign from the American Manufacturing Council. Since then, a steady stream of high‑profile confrontations has forced CEOs across technology, consumer goods and finance to adopt either defensive silence, selective alignment with nationalist themes, or outright roll‑backs of “woke” initiatives. Intel’s Lip‑Bu Tan, for example, answered a Trump accusation in October 2020 by affirming a shared commitment to U.S. national security, while Apple’s Tim Cook simply defended the company’s privacy changes and declined to comment on politics after a January 2021 tweet labelled him a “radical leftist”.

The financial impact is evident. Bud Light’s partnership with TikTok creator Dylan Mulvaney was withdrawn in May 2023, triggering a 20 % year‑on‑year volume decline and a market‑share loss from 13.5 % to 10.8 %. Target’s Pride‑month merchandise faced a boycott in June 2023, contributing to a 1.2 % same‑store sales dip in Q3 2023 despite overall revenue growth. Under Armour saw its stock tumble 15 % in 2022 after CEO Patrik Frisk’s pro‑Trump tweet, while Intel’s shares slipped 5 % on the day Trump posted a video demanding the CEO’s resignation in August 2024. Across Fortune 500 firms, at least 30 % have scaled back DEI programmes since 2022, reflecting a broader corporate retreat from culturally progressive policies.

Strategically, CEOs are converging on four recurring patterns. First, a majority adopt public neutrality or silence, using “neutrality” as a shield against political retaliation. Second, they execute targeted roll‑backs—such as Ford’s pause on a limited‑edition Pride interior option in July 2023—while preserving core DEI commitments internally. Third, brands re‑brand with patriotic narratives: Ford’s “Built for America” ads and Anheuser‑Busch’s “All‑American” Bud Light campaign in August 2023 aim to recapture conservative consumers. Fourth, board‑level alignment has become routine; Intel’s board issued a full‑support statement after Trump’s criticism, and financial giants Bank of America and JPMorgan launched “political‑neutrality” training for senior staff in 2024.

The broader political backdrop amplifies these corporate calculations. Trump’s current “war on woke” is a continuation of rhetoric that began in 2015, but it now carries the weight of executive orders banning DEI training in federal agencies (January 2025) and threatening funding cuts for “woke” university curricula (February 2025). Historical parallels run to the 1990s “culture wars” and earlier battles over civil‑rights and “political correctness”, yet today’s campaign wields direct regulatory tools rather than solely rhetorical attacks.

Bottom line: CEOs are split. A minority, such as Merck’s former chair, openly reject Trump’s agenda; the majority opt for damage‑control or patriotic repositioning to protect brand equity. The market response is swift—positive Trump endorsements can lift a stock by 10‑15 % (American Eagle’s 14 % jump in January 2025), while negative labeling triggers short‑term sell‑offs of 5‑10 % (Target’s 9 % dip in October 2024). Yet long‑term revenue resilience remains for firms that stay the course, with Nike posting a 3 % YoY profit rise despite repeated “woke” attacks. As the cultural battle intensifies, the fortunes of US brands will continue to diverge along the lines drawn by Trump’s renewed crusade.
