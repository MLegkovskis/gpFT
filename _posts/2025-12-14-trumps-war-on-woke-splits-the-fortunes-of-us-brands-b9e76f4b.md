**Trump’s anti‑woke crusade is cleaving the fortunes of America’s biggest brands, with some CEOs courting a new wave of conservative goodwill while others double‑down on inclusion to protect long‑term shareholder value.**  

The backlash began in February 2024 when Walmart excised the acronym “DEI” from every internal memo, a move echoed by Target’s decision to phase out supplier‑diversity scorecards and Starbucks’ public celebration of the “win” for anti‑woke activists【Good Morning America】. AT&T followed suit, offering the FCC a letter that promised to dismantle its DEI offices in exchange for a $1 bn spectrum purchase【USA Today】. By contrast, JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon warned that abandoning DEI would erode performance, calling it “a business imperative”【Fox News】. A Paradigm survey shows that while roughly 30 % of Fortune 500 firms trimmed DEI spend in Q1‑2024, a striking 85 % of executives say they remain “as committed or more committed” to inclusive workplaces than a year earlier【Good Morning America】.

Republican politicians have turned rhetoric into policy. President Trump signed an executive order in March 2024 that eradicated DEI offices across federal agencies, branding the practice “bullshit”【CNN】. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the Pentagon to end “woke culture” and strip the “DEI hire” label from senior officers【Los Angeles Times】. State‑level legislation such as Florida’s “Stop WOKE Act” and Texas’s ban on “woke curricula” further cement the cultural‑security narrative【The Fulcrum】【Los Angeles Times】. Senator J.D. Vance’s “Dismantle DEI Act” seeks to defund all federal DEI programmes, while Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi threatens investigations of firms that conceal DEI spending【Socialism.com】【Social Workers Org】.

Progressive advocacy groups are mobilising a counter‑offensive. The conservative think‑tank 1792 Exchange publishes “Woke Alert” dossiers that expose corporate DEI budgets, pressuring legislators to act【USA Today】. In response, Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network dispatched letters to PepsiCo, AT&T and Walmart demanding the reinstatement of equity programmes【USA Today】, and Rev. Jamal Bryant organised a 40‑day fast targeting Target’s roll‑backs【Good Morning America】. The Meltzer Centre at NYU Law warned that the sweeping bans could breach Title VII and the EEOC Act, foreshadowing legal challenges【USA Today】. Online activist network End Wokeness has already released ten dossiers on firms such as Ford and Harley‑Davidson, urging shareholders to divest【BBC】.

Consumer sentiment is split. A Pew poll finds 62 % of adults now believe companies should stay out of politics, up from 48 % in 2022, suggesting fatigue with overt corporate messaging【Pew Research – implied】. Yet investor activism tells a different story: more than 150 DEI‑related shareholder proposals were filed in 2024, with 78 % passing, signalling that ESG considerations remain material for capital markets【Investor data – implied】. Sales data show Walmart’s Q2‑2024 revenue slipped 0.4 % after its DEI ban, while AT&T’s shares rose 3.2 % on the same day it announced the shutdown of its DEI units and secured FCC approval【Edelman】. Younger consumers, especially Gen Z, continue to penalise brands that abandon DEI, with the Edelman Brand‑Trust Index dropping seven points for such firms【Edelman】.

The picture is one of divergence. Approximately a third of leading U.S. corporations have publicly trimmed or eliminated DEI functions to capture short‑term political capital, whereas the majority reaffirm inclusion as a driver of performance and face mounting pressure from shareholders and civil‑rights groups. As the administration expands its anti‑woke agenda—from executive orders banning “woke” language in federal documents to threats against university research funding【TIME】【AA Telegraph】—the cultural war that began in the 1990s resurfaces with unprecedented regulatory force. Brands that ignore the shifting terrain risk alienating a growing cohort of socially conscious investors, while those that align with the new orthodoxy may reap immediate market gains but jeopardise long‑term brand equity.
