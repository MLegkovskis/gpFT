# European Traders Celebrate Decade-Beating Performance
European traders are celebrating a decade-beating performance, with the five biggest European banks generating a combined €43.9bn in trading revenue in 2025. This marks the strongest level since 2015, with Barclays and Deutsche Bank leading the pack.
## Key Drivers of the Exceptional Performance
The exceptional performance can be attributed to several key drivers, including:
* A tech-heavy equity rally, led by ASML's 26% annualized return and double-digit gains in other growth stocks
* Macro-driven trends, such as geopolitical tension, AI-related capital flows, and anticipated defense/infrastructure spending
* Sharp, news-driven single-stock moves, such as RELX's 10% surge
## Revenue Numbers and Growth Rates
The revenue numbers and growth rates cited as evidence of this exceptional performance include:
* €43.9bn in combined trading revenue across the five biggest European banks in 2025, a 22% increase from 2024
* €10.1bn in trading revenue for Barclays, a 15% year-on-year increase
* €9.6bn in FICC revenue for Deutsche Bank, pushing the bank into second place
## Outlook and Implications
The outlook for European traders remains optimistic, with Goldman Sachs predicting a 5-6% upside in the next 12 months. However, some bankers have warned of market frothiness, citing huge investments in AI and data centers.
