**The Federal Reserve’s reluctance to ease monetary policy, even as inflation eases and the labour market cools, has sparked a growing chorus of criticism that the central bank is fashionably late in responding to the United Kingdom’s own post‑pandemic recovery challenges.**  

## A Shifting Economic Landscape  

US macro data released in the past month show a mixed picture. The consumer‑price index (CPI) rose 0.3 % in March 2024, bringing the 12‑month rate down to 3.2 % – the lowest level since mid‑2022 but still well above the Fed’s 2 % target. Core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, the Fed’s preferred gauge, eased to 3.4 % YoY in March from 3.7 % in February.  

On the labour front, the unemployment rate edged up to 3.6 % in February, the highest reading since October 2023, while weekly jobless claims rose to 221,000, signalling a modest softening in hiring momentum. Real GDP growth slowed to an annualised 1.8 % in Q1 2024, down from 2.4 % in the previous quarter.  

## Policy Stance: Holding the Line  

At its March 2024 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 5.25‑5.50 %, the highest level in 23 years. The statement highlighted “continued vigilance” over inflation and noted that “the path to achieving the 2 % goal remains uncertain.” No forward guidance was offered, and the Fed’s “dot‑plot” showed a median projection of three more 25‑basis‑point cuts by the end of 2025 – a pace slower than many market participants had anticipated.  

## Market Reactions  

Bond yields have responded with a modest rise: the 10‑year Treasury yield climbed to 4.45 % on the day of the announcement, its highest level since early 2023. The US dollar index slipped 0.4 % against a basket of major currencies, while equity markets remained flat, reflecting investors’ “wait‑and‑see” stance.  

## The Case for a Timelier Pivot  

Critics argue that the Fed’s inertia risks a “policy lag” that could exacerbate a potential slowdown. If inflation continues to drift above 2 % while growth stalls, the central bank may be forced into a sharper, more abrupt easing cycle later in the year – a scenario that could unsettle financial markets and raise borrowing costs for both households and businesses.  

Conversely, proponents of the current stance point to the still‑elevated core inflation and the risk that premature rate cuts could reignite price pressures, especially given the still‑tight labour market and resilient consumer spending.  

## Outlook  

All eyes now turn to the Fed’s next communication. The March 2024 minutes, due later this week, are expected to reveal whether policymakers see the recent data as a signal to begin a gradual unwind or as a reason to maintain the current “higher‑for‑longer” posture. In the meantime, the “fashionably late” narrative will continue to shape market sentiment, especially for investors with exposure to US‑denominated assets and for policymakers in the United Kingdom, who are watching the Fed’s moves as a benchmark for their own monetary decisions.
