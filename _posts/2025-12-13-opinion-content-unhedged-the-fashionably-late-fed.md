**The Fashionably Late Fed: An Analysis of the Current Monetary Policy Timeline**
=================================================================

**The Fed's monetary policy timeline has been under scrutiny, with many questioning whether the current approach is effective in combating post-pandemic inflation**. A thorough examination of the current cycle (2022-2025) and a comparison with previous economic downturns reveal a more nuanced narrative. The Fed's rapid tightening in 2022-2023 was followed by a pivot to gradual easing in 2024-2025, utilizing a broader set of policy instruments, including balance-sheet normalization and explicit forward guidance.

The current cycle began with a rapid tightening phase, characterized by seven hikes totaling +4.25 percentage points between March 2022 and March 2023. This was followed by a shift towards gradual easing, with the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points in March 2024 and September 2025. The current fed funds target range stands at 3.50-3.75%, with the Fed signaling a data-dependent approach to future policy decisions.

In comparison to previous downturns, the current cycle's speed of rate changes is notable. The 2001-2002 recession saw 13 cuts of 0.25 percentage points each, ending at 1.00% in December 2001. The Great Recession, on the other hand, was marked by rapid cuts, with the federal funds rate reduced from 5.25% to a range of 0-0.25% in December 2008. The 1994-1995 "soft-landing" tightening saw aggressive rate hikes, doubling the fed funds rate to approximately 6.00% by February 1995.

The Fed's toolkit has expanded significantly since the early 2000s, with the inclusion of balance-sheet normalization (QT) and explicit forward guidance. The current cycle has seen the Fed utilize these tools to achieve a more measured easing, while still matching the speed of past tightening when inflation pressures demanded it.

The impact of the Fed's actions on the latest GDP reading is evident. The Q2 2025 GDP figure was revised upward, primarily reflecting an increase in consumer spending. The Fed's rate cut has made credit cheaper, encouraging businesses and consumers to borrow and invest. Fixed investment was also revised higher, consistent with the Fed's measured approach to future policy changes.

The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model estimates real GDP growth to be 3.6% for Q3 2025, suggesting that the Fed-induced stimulus is persisting. Trading Economics expects GDP growth to be 2.10% by the end of 2025 and approximately 2.00% in 2026. The Fed's own Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) now projects median 2.3% GDP growth for 2026, reflecting the belief that the recent rate cuts will keep growth above the long-run 2% trend.
