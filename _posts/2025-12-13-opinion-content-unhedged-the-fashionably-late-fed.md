**The Federal Reserve’s “fashionably late” rate cuts – three quarter‑point reductions in 2025, a divided FOMC vote and a cautious outlook for 2026 – have left markets recalibrating expectations as the US economy shows mixed signals of slowing growth, stubborn inflation and a still‑tight labour market.**

## Economic backdrop

US real GDP grew at an annualised 1.8 % in Q3 2025, down from 2.4 % in Q2, while the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE) remained at 2.6 % year‑on‑year, above the Fed’s 2 % target. The unemployment rate held at 3.7 %, near a 50‑year low, and the labour‑force participation rate edged up to 62.8 %. These figures illustrate a decoupling: growth is cooling but the job market stays resilient.

## Fed’s recent actions

At its December 10, 2025 meeting the Federal Open Market Committee lowered the federal‑funds target range by 25 basis points to 3.50‑3.75 %, the third consecutive cut of the year and the first trio of reductions since September 2019. The vote was 12‑3 in favour; dissent came from three members – two voting against any change and one preferring a 50‑basis‑point cut. Chair Jerome Powell described the move as “data‑dependent” and signalled that the current range is “close to neutral”.

## Market expectations versus policy

CME FedWatch placed the probability of an additional 25‑basis‑point cut at 88 % ahead of the next meeting, reflecting a market that had been pricing a rate of 3.25‑3.50 % by late‑2026. However, the Fed’s dot‑plot released in December projects only one further cut in 2026, leaving the year‑end 2027 target at 3.00‑3.25 %. This divergence underscores the “fashionably late” perception: policymakers are trimming rates but at a slower pace than market participants anticipate.

## Implications for financial markets

* **Equities:** The S&P 500 has risen 4 % since the September cut but remains volatile, with the VIX hovering around 18.5. Analysts warn that a prolonged pause could trigger a sector‑wide rotation from growth to value stocks.
* **Fixed income:** The 10‑year Treasury yield slipped to 3.9 % after the December decision, while the yield curve steepened modestly, suggesting expectations of modest future growth.
* **Currency:** The dollar index (DXY) fell 0.6 % on the day of the cut, easing pressure on emerging‑market currencies that had been under strain from a stronger greenback.

## Global spill‑over

A softer dollar eases financing costs for emerging markets, yet the Fed’s cautious stance leaves the global policy mix uneven. Europe’s ECB remains on a tightening trajectory, with its main refinancing rate at 4.00 %, while the Bank of England holds at 5.25 %. The divergence could sustain capital flows into the US, tempering the dollar’s decline.

## Outlook

The Fed’s next decision, due in March 2026, will hinge on the first‑quarter labour data and the PCE inflation report due in February. If unemployment nudges above 4.5 % and inflation eases below 2.5 %, a second cut in 2026 becomes plausible. Until then, the “late” narrative will persist, with markets watching for any shift from the current “wait‑and‑see” posture.
