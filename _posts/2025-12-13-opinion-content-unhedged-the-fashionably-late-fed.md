**The Federal Reserve’s cautious stance has drawn renewed criticism as inflation eases only marginally and growth stalls, prompting analysts to argue that the central bank’s delayed tightening may have already ceded ground to market volatility.**  

## Inflation trajectory and policy lag  

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.2 % year‑on‑year in August 2025, down from a peak of 9.1 % in June 2022 but still above the Fed’s 2 % target. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, eased to 3.0 % in the same month, marking the slowest decline since early 2023. Despite this moderation, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kept the target federal‑funds rate at 5.25‑5.50 % at its July 2025 meeting, signalling “patient” monitoring rather than immediate cuts. Critics contend that the first rate hikes in March 2022, followed by a total of seven 0.75‑percentage‑point moves, arrived after inflation had already entrenched, leaving the economy exposed to a “policy‑rate lag” that could amplify future corrections.  

## Growth, labour market and the risk of a soft landing  

Real GDP expanded at an annualised 2.1 % in Q2 2025, a slowdown from 2.8 % in Q1. The slowdown reflects weaker consumer spending, with retail sales growth decelerating to 1.4 % month‑on‑month in August, compared with 3.2 % a year earlier. The unemployment rate held at 3.8 % in August, marginally above the 3.5 % “full‑employment” benchmark, while the labour‑force participation rate slipped to 62.4 %, its lowest level since 2015. These figures fuel debate over whether the Fed can achieve a soft landing without further tightening.  

## Market reaction and forward guidance  

Equity markets have responded with heightened volatility: the S&P 500 posted a 7 % decline from its March 2025 peak, while the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) hovered around 22, double its pre‑pandemic norm. Treasury yields rose modestly, with the 10‑year note yielding 4.35 % in early September, reflecting investor expectations of a gradual rate‑cut cycle beginning in late 2025. Nonetheless, bond market analysts warn that the Fed’s “wait‑and‑see” posture may have already priced in a steeper curve correction should inflation prove stickier.  

## Outlook and policy options  

The Fed’s July statement highlighted “moderate confidence” that inflation will converge to target by year‑end, yet it left open the possibility of “pre‑emptive” action if price pressures re‑intensify. Some economists advocate a modest 25‑basis‑point hike in the November 2025 meeting to reinforce credibility, while others argue for a data‑dependent pause to avoid choking the fragile recovery. The balance between curbing residual inflation and sustaining growth will define the Fed’s narrative for the remainder of the year.
