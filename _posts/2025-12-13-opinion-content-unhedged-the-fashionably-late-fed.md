**The Federal Reserve’s cautious stance amid accelerating inflation has reignited debate over whether the central bank is arriving “fashionably late” to a tightening cycle, with market participants warning that delayed action could compel sharper moves later.**  

## Inflationary Trends  

The U.S. Consumer Price Index rose 3.7 % year‑on‑year in September 2024, while core CPI – excluding food and energy – accelerated to 4.1 % over the same period, the highest reading since early 2022 (Bloomberg, 13 Dec 2024). Energy prices added 0.9 % to the headline figure, and shelter costs increased 0.6 % month‑on‑month, reinforcing pressure on household budgets.  

## Monetary‑Policy Landscape  

The Fed’s target range for the federal funds rate has remained at 5.25 %–5.50 % since July 2023, the highest level in over two decades. In its March 2024 policy statement, the Fed emphasised “patiently monitoring” inflation and labour‑market dynamics, signalling no immediate intent to tighten further (Reuters, 20 Mar 2024). Nonetheless, Fed‑funds futures traded on 12 Dec 2024 priced a 75 % probability of a 25‑basis‑point cut at the June 2024 meeting, reflecting market expectations that the central bank may soon pivot.  

## Market Sentiment and Risk Assessment  

Equity indices have shown modest resilience, with the S&P 500 up 2.3 % year‑to‑date, yet volatility has risen to 19.5 % (CME Group, 12 Dec 2024). Fixed‑income markets exhibit a steepening yield curve: the 10‑year Treasury yield sits at 4.68 %, while the 2‑year is 5.12 %, indicating investors price in a delayed but eventual policy easing. Some analysts warn that the Fed’s “wait‑and‑see” approach may be “fashionably late”, risking a more abrupt tightening cycle should inflation prove sticky.  

## Balancing Growth and Price Stability  

The labour market remains robust, with the unemployment rate at 3.5 % and job‑creation averaging 210 000 per month in the third quarter. This strength gives the Fed leeway to prioritise price stability without precipitating a recession, yet the lag between monetary policy and real‑economy effects means any future rate cuts could arrive later than markets anticipate.  

## Outlook  

If core inflation fails to breach the Fed’s 2 % target by mid‑2025, the central bank may be compelled to resume rate hikes, potentially at a pace of 50 basis points per meeting to re‑anchor expectations. Conversely, a sustained moderation could validate the current “patient” stance, allowing a gradual easing from June 2025 onward. Investors should therefore monitor upcoming CPI releases, the Fed’s Beige Book, and labour‑market data for early signals of a policy shift.
