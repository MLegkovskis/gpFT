**Australian users flock to new platforms after social media ban for under-16s**
====================================================================

**Australia has become the first country to introduce a nationwide ban on social media for under-16s**, with the _Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Act 2024_ coming into effect on December 10, 2025. The legislation, which amends the _Online Safety Act 2021_, prohibits individuals under the age of 16 from holding an account on listed platforms, including TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Threads, Reddit, Twitch, and Kick. According to a [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/australia-social-media-ban-takes-effect-world-first-2025-12-09/) report, the ban is expected to affect approximately 4.5 million under-16 users, who will need to find alternative platforms to access social media.

The ban has been met with criticism from tech industry leaders, with Meta, TikTok, and Snap expressing concerns about the legislation. In a statement to the Australian Senate, TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, said, "The ban risks pushing teens to less-regulated corners of the internet and does little to protect them." Similarly, Meta estimates that it has approximately 450,000 under-16 accounts in Australia, which will be affected by the ban. As reported by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce86381p70eo), the ban is expected to result in a significant migration of under-16 users to platforms not covered by the law, such as Discord, Telegram, and emerging short-form apps.

Data from the eSafety Commissioner shows that there has been a significant shift in user behavior, with a 45% jump in downloads of Discord and a 38% rise in Telegram downloads in the first week after the ban, according to [Sensor Tower](https://sensortower.com/blog/australia-discord-telegram-spike-dec-2025). This trend is consistent with the comments of a teenager quoted in [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/australia-social-media-ban-takes-effect-world-first-2025-12-09/), who said, "It's just kind of pointless, we're just going to create new ways to get on these platforms, so what's the point."

The ban is also expected to have an impact on the digital advertising market, with estimates suggesting a potential loss of AU$100-150 million in ad revenue for the platforms affected. However, this loss may be offset by the growth of alternative platforms, such as YouTube, which is exempt from the ban. According to [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-demographics-australia/), YouTube may see a significant uptick in under-16 users, potentially adding AU$30-50 million in ad revenue for the platform alone.

In comparison to other countries, Australia's ban is more stringent than the UK's _Age-Appropriate Design Code_, which requires platforms to design services that are safe for children by default, but does not impose a hard age cut-off. The Australian ban is also more comprehensive, covering a wider range of platforms and imposing stricter penalties for non-compliance. As noted by the [ACMA](https://www.acma.gov.au/articles/2024/11/29/social-media-minimum-age), the ban is intended to protect children from online harms, including addictive algorithms, online predators, and cyberbullying.

In conclusion, the social media ban for under-16s in Australia is a significant development in the regulation of online platforms. While the ban has been met with criticism from tech industry leaders, it is intended to protect children from online harms and promote a safer online environment. As the ban continues to be enforced, it will be important to monitor its impact on the digital advertising market and the behavior of under-16 users.
