  - "The EU's 'Buy European' rules may create de-facto barriers to international trade, conflicting with WTO-GPA obligations and bilateral free-trade agreements."
  - "The rules could lead to a 10-15% increase in the probability of reciprocal procurement restrictions from affected partners within two years."
  - "The United States, not a GPA signatory, may lose automatic access to EU public-procurement markets, potentially reducing US-EU procurement flows by €3 billion per year."

The European Union's proposed 'Buy European' rules have sparked controversy, with potential implications for international trade agreements. The rules, anchored in the EU's 2014 public-procurement directives, allow preferential treatment of 'European' bidders when reciprocity is lacking. Recent ECJ rulings have confirmed that third-country operators without a reciprocal procurement treaty cannot rely on EU procurement law. The rules may create de-facto barriers that conflict with the WTO-GPA and bilateral free-trade agreements, potentially leading to formal disputes or retaliatory procurement bans. Trade-policy analysts estimate a 10-15% increase in the probability of reciprocal restrictions from affected partners within two years of rule implementation. The United States, which is not a GPA signatory, would lose automatic access to EU public-procurement markets for firms that do not obtain a 'European' status, potentially reducing US-EU procurement flows by €3 billion per year.
