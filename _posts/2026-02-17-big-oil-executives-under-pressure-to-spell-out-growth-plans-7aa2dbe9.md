# Big Oil Executives Under Pressure to Outline Growth Plans
The growth plans announced by Big Oil executives have been met with scrutiny, as they largely diverge from the global shift towards renewable energy. Despite the increasing demand for renewable energy sources, Exxon, Shell, and BP are focusing on new oil-and-gas output, with modest investments in low-carbon projects.
## Divergence from Global Renewable Trend
The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that global renewable electricity capacity will rise from 3,200 GW in 2023 to 5,000 GW by 2030, representing a 60% increase. However, the growth plans announced by Big Oil executives do not align with this trend. Exxon is allocating $20 billion to lower-emissions opportunities, but this investment is not aimed at phasing out fossil production. Shell has earmarked $40 billion for oil-and-gas development between 2023 and 2035, with production expected to remain stable until 2030. BP has cut its renewable-investment budget from over $5 billion to $1.5-2 billion per year, with a focus on selective, capital-light low-carbon projects.
## Implications for Long-Term Financial Sustainability
The divergence from the global renewable trend creates material financial risks for the majors, including stranded assets, higher carbon-pricing costs, and investor activism. The IEA forecasts that oil demand will peak around 2029-2030, which could lead to uneconomic upstream capacity and force write-downs. The $113.8 billion paid out to shareholders in 2023 reduces internal cash that could be used for renewable-energy R&D, potentially leaving majors under-invested as the market shifts.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, the growth plans announced by Big Oil executives are largely at odds with the global shift towards renewable energy. While TotalEnergies is pursuing an integrated-power ambition with a focus on renewable power, the other majors are emphasizing new oil-and-gas output with modest investments in low-carbon projects. This divergence creates significant financial risks, and it remains to be seen how the majors will adapt to the changing energy landscape.
