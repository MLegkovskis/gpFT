# Nvidia and OpenAI Abandon $100bn Deal in Favor of $30bn Investment
Nvidia and OpenAI have announced that they are abandoning their initial $100bn deal in favor of a significantly lower $30bn investment. This new deal secures Nvidia as the primary hardware supplier for OpenAI's next wave of models, preserving a major revenue stream and cementing Nvidia's position at the heart of the AI compute stack.
## Implications for the Broader Tech Industry
The deal has several implications for the broader tech industry. The $30bn investment will still fund OpenAI's next-generation models and the construction of multiple new data-center clusters using Nvidia H100/H200 GPUs. This will reinforce Nvidia's dominance in GPU-based AI and slow the adoption of alternative APIs.
## Competitive Dynamics
The reduction in investment from $100bn to $30bn opens space for competitors, such as AMD and Intel, to win a larger share of OpenAI's future hardware spend. AMD has already announced a $2bn commitment to supply GPUs to OpenAI's edge-compute nodes.
## Regulatory Scrutiny
The deal also intensifies vertical integration concerns, with the U.S. FTC opening a pre-merger review of Nvidia-OpenAI ties. This could lead to greater regulatory scrutiny and potentially impact the growth trajectory of the AI industry.
## Investor Sentiment
Nvidia's stock fell approximately 10% after the $100bn deal was reported stalled, but recovered approximately 6% after the $30bn announcement. This indicates that markets view the smaller deal as still materially supportive.
