**Wall Street’s five biggest banks are on track to deliver the strongest investment‑banking earnings since the pandemic, with quarterly revenue up 13 % year‑on‑year and full‑year fees projected to rise 50 % from the 2023 trough.** The surge, driven by robust deal flow across mergers and acquisitions, equity capital markets and leveraged finance, is set to push total investment‑banking revenue for the group to almost $38 billion in 2025 – a level not seen since the pre‑COVID boom.

The latest quarterly figures for Q4 2025 underscore the momentum. The five leading U.S. banks – JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup – are expected to report investment‑banking revenues of close to $10 billion, a 13 % increase over the same quarter a year earlier. This uptick reflects a broad‑based recovery in client activity, with firms turning to Wall Street for both advisory services and financing as confidence returns to the market.

When the quarterly data are annualised, the picture becomes even more striking. Total investment‑banking revenue for the five banks is projected at roughly $38 billion for 2025, representing a 50 % jump from the pandemic‑low of $25 billion recorded in 2023. The half‑century rise signals that the sector has not only recovered but is now expanding at a pace that rivals the pre‑pandemic high of 2019, when deal volumes were similarly vigorous.

Looking ahead, the upward trajectory appears set to continue. Analysts forecast an 11 % rise in fees for both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in 2026, suggesting that the drivers of the current boom – strong M&A pipelines, resilient equity markets and sustained demand for high‑yield financing – will remain in place. The consensus among market watchers is that the combination of low‑interest‑rate environments and corporate appetite for strategic transactions is fueling a virtuous cycle of fee generation.

The implications for investors are significant. Higher investment‑banking fees translate into stronger earnings for the banks, bolstering their profitability and potentially supporting dividend payouts and share buy‑backs. Moreover, the robust activity signals confidence in the broader economy, as corporations are willing to commit capital to expansion, restructuring and capital‑raising initiatives.

While the data paint an optimistic outlook, the sector remains exposed to macro‑economic headwinds, including potential interest‑rate volatility and geopolitical uncertainties that could temper deal flow. Nonetheless, the current performance sets a new benchmark for Wall Street, positioning the United States’ premier investment banks at the forefront of a global resurgence in corporate finance activity.
