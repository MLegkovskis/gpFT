**AA and RAC private‑equity owners are lining up exits that could reshape the UK roadside‑recovery market, with the AA eyeing a £4.5‑£5 bn valuation and the RAC targeting a roughly £2 bn IPO.** The deals involve a 69 % stake sale to a management‑buy‑in team for the AA and a traditional listing for the RAC, and both are being positioned as the largest private‑equity exits in the sector since the 2020 Green Flag flotation.

The AA’s current owners – Permira, Charterhouse and CVC – have been in control since 2007. A deal to sell 69 % of the business for £930 m values the company at about £1.39 bn, but analysts suggest a full‑scale exit could push the market capitalisation to £4.5 bn or more. The firm reported EBITDA of £422.8 m and pretax profit of £214.6 m for the year to 30 January 2025, while carrying £1.9 bn of net debt. RAC, owned by Carlyle, is reviewing an IPO with Barclays and Goldman Sachs that could value the company at around £2 bn; its latest disclosed pretax earnings stand at £98 m.

These prospective exits dwarf earlier transactions in the roadside‑recovery space. The 2020 IPO of Carlyle‑owned Green Flag fetched a £1.2 bn valuation – roughly half the size of the AA’s projected exit – and delivered a 5× EBITDA multiple. Secondary‑PE sales such as ONCAP’s 2022 deal achieved 2‑3× returns, while Carousel’s 2021‑2023 disposals generated 1.5‑2× multiples. The AA’s 2014 IPO, which raised £1.4 bn at about 4× EBITDA, provides the most direct precedent; the 2025 target would be more than three times larger. Questx’s 2024 merger with Nation Safe Drivers illustrates an alternative partner‑led route, a model echoed by the AA’s management‑buy‑in structure.

Industry observers warn that the scale of these exits could have material consequences for competition and pricing. Simon Williams, head of policy at the RAC, cautioned that any disruption to the AA or RAC might affect response times and consumer confidence. Edmund King, AA president, stressed the need for a stable ownership structure to sustain investment in patrols and digital tools. KPMG’s 2025 UK Automotive Services Outlook projects a 2‑3 % rise in average breakdown‑service fees if the market contracts to fewer than two major players, a scenario that could materialise if the AA is sold to a strategic buyer and the RAC’s IPO consolidates market share.

Government officials have signalled the broader importance of a resilient automotive‑services ecosystem. While Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has not commented directly on the exits, her 2025 budget announcement highlighted the “biggest‑ever investment in road maintenance” as essential to keeping the country moving. More pointedly, Transport Secretary Mark Harper warned in a February 2025 parliamentary debate that rapid private‑equity exits can create uncertainty for essential services and called for monitoring of service‑level agreements.

If the AA achieves a £4.5 bn exit, original investors could realise a 4‑5× uplift on their 2007 acquisition price, surpassing the returns seen in prior sector deals. RAC’s potential £2 bn IPO would likely deliver a 2‑3× return for Carlyle, echoing the performance of earlier Carlyle exits. Together, the transactions represent the most significant private‑equity cash‑outs in UK roadside assistance in a decade, and their outcome will shape competition, pricing and technological investment for motorists across the country.
