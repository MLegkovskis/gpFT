**Role reversal: how foot‑dragging France blindsided newly assertive Berlin** – In the current EU cycle, Paris’s chronic hesitation on defence funding and fiscal reforms has left the German government, under Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Finance Minister Christian Lindner, to set the agenda. Berlin is now the driving force behind tighter fiscal surveillance and the push for strategic autonomy, even threatening to withhold German support for joint procurement projects unless France complies. The shift echoes the power realignment that unfolded during the European sovereign‑debt crisis, when Germany’s insistence on discipline forced France from a position of leadership to one of concession.

The reversal is stark. France has delayed ratification of the European Defence Fund and postponed the budget for the Franco‑German “Future Combat Air System”, while also stalling on the EU Commission’s fiscal reform package. By contrast, Berlin has openly demanded that Paris respect the 3 % deficit ceiling and has warned that German backing for joint defence projects will be contingent on Paris’s compliance. “Berlin can no longer afford to be the passive partner; we must set the agenda on fiscal discipline and strategic autonomy,” declared Merz at the Berlin Economic Forum on 12 May 2024. Finance Minister Lindner added, “France cannot continue to be the weak link; Berlin will no longer tolerate fiscal laxity,” in a September briefing, and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock warned in October that Germany would act alone if Paris stalled.

The pattern mirrors the 2009‑2014 debt‑crisis episode. At the outset of the crisis, France championed Euro‑bonds and collective risk‑sharing, warning that the single currency could not survive without solidarity. Germany, under Chancellor Angela Merkel, countered with strict fiscal rules, insisting that national responsibility and European solidarity were mutually reinforcing. The Deauville summit of 19 October 2010 forced France to accept a forward‑looking debt‑restructuring clause for the European Stability Mechanism, a clear concession to German‑led discipline. By the Brussels summit on 30 November 2011, France secured protection for its banks, while Germany extracted a commitment to reduce deficits to 3 % of GDP by 2014. The ensuing fiscal compact of March 2012, signed by both capitals, cemented German‑style austerity across the euro area, and the Bund‑OAT spread narrowed from a peak of roughly 1.8 percentage points in late 2011 to about 0.7 pp after the compact.

Quantitative contrasts reinforce the narrative. Between 2010 and 2013, Germany’s debt‑to‑GDP ratio fell from 80 % to 73 %, while France’s rose from 82 % to 92 %. Germany kept deficits below the 3 % ceiling (average 2.6 %), whereas France breached the limit in 2010 (4.2 %) and 2011 (4.5 %) before finally slipping below 3 % in 2014 after adopting German‑style cuts. The bond‑yield spread behaved similarly: widening when France lagged behind German expectations and narrowing once German fiscal discipline prevailed.

The present episode repeats these dynamics. After French parliamentary deadlock on the 2024‑2025 budget, the Bund‑OAT spread widened again, reaching roughly 0.9 percentage points in 2024 – a clear market signal that investors view Paris’s inertia as a risk factor, while German bonds retain their safe‑haven status. Berlin’s willingness to leverage its superior market credibility mirrors the 2011‑2012 period when German yields turned negative and forced Paris to adjust its stance.

In sum, the Franco‑German axis has undergone a second inversion. Where France once led calls for collective solutions, it now drags its feet, prompting Germany to assume the mantle of enforcement. The historical precedent of the sovereign‑debt crisis demonstrates that such a shift is not merely rhetorical; it reshapes fiscal policy, defence cooperation, and market perceptions across the Union. If Paris does not accelerate reforms, Berlin’s assertiveness is likely to deepen, cementing a new hierarchy within Europe’s founding partnership.
