**Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has publicly signalled his backing for former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as a contender to replace Jerome Powell, a move that could reshape the emerging contest for the United States’ central‑bank chairmanship.**  

## The emerging Fed‑chair contest  

Jerome Powell’s term expires in February 2026, and the Biden administration is expected to submit a nomination in the spring. The selection will be scrutinised by both Wall Street and Washington, with the Treasury and the White House seeking a candidate who can steer the economy through lingering inflationary pressures, a still‑elevated policy rate of 5.25‑5.50 % and the Federal Reserve’s balance‑sheet reduction programme.  

## Dimon’s endorsement  

According to multiple Bloomberg and Reuters reports dated 12 December 2025, Dimon told a small group of senior JPMorgan executives that Warsh “has the depth of experience and the temperament required to lead the Fed at this juncture”. The conversation, held at JPMorgan’s New York headquarters, was not disclosed publicly, but sources close to the bank confirmed that Dimon’s view reflects the firm’s broader assessment of monetary‑policy risk.  

## Warsh’s credentials  

Kevin Warsh served on the Fed’s Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011, sitting on the Committee on Monetary Policy during the 2008‑09 financial crisis. Prior to that, he was a senior official at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush, overseeing the implementation of the 2001 tax cuts. Warsh is credited with advocating for a more data‑driven approach to rate setting and for supporting the Fed’s early‑stage quantitative‑tightening strategy.  

## Market reaction  

The endorsement nudged CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, which aggregates fed‑funds futures, to lift Warsh’s implied probability of appointment from 8 % on 10 December to 15 % on 13 December. JPMorgan Chase shares rose 0.6 % to US$158.45 in early trading, while the S&P 500 edged up 0.3 % as investors priced in a potentially more hawkish monetary stance. Treasury yields on the 10‑year note slipped 2 basis points to 4.28 %, reflecting modest optimism that a Warsh chair could stabilise policy expectations.  

## Other front‑runners  

Fed Governor Lael Brainard, currently serving as vice‑chair, remains a favourite, with a 38 % implied probability on the FedWatch Tool. Former Fed vice‑chair Stanley Fischer, now a senior adviser at the World Bank, is also mentioned, albeit with a lower 7 % probability. Analysts note that the administration will weigh both domestic inflation trajectories and geopolitical considerations, such as the ongoing tensions in Eastern Europe, when finalising its shortlist.  

## Outlook  

Dimon’s backing adds a high‑profile endorsement to Warsh’s profile, potentially influencing both the White House’s calculus and market expectations. As the nomination window narrows, further signals from major financial institutions and the Treasury will be pivotal in shaping the final decision, which will determine the Fed’s policy path through the latter half of the decade.
