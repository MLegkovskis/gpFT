**Jamie Dimon signals support for Kevin Warsh in Fed chair race**
**In a significant development, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has expressed support for Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair, according to a report by the Financial Times.** This endorsement is notable, given Dimon's influence in the financial industry and the potential implications of a Warsh chairmanship on US monetary policy. Warsh, a former Fed governor, has been known for his hawkish stance on interest rates and his skepticism of quantitative easing.

As the data suggests, a Warsh chairmanship could have a significant impact on US GDP growth. With his stated preference for tighter monetary policy, including higher interest rates and a smaller balance sheet, Warsh's leadership could lead to a reduction in GDP growth. According to a working paper by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, a 25-basis-point increase in the federal-funds rate reduces GDP growth by approximately 0.15 percentage points over the next 12 months. This implies that a more aggressive tightening path under Warsh could push growth below 1%, a level not seen since the early 2000s recession.

The industry's reaction to a potential Warsh chairmanship is mixed, with Dimon's endorsement being the most explicit statement of support. Other major banking executives, such as Goldman Sachs' David Solomon, have emphasized the importance of preserving the Fed's independence, without explicitly endorsing Warsh. The collective statements from these executives reveal a strong emphasis on Fed independence, a cautious approach to endorsing any candidate, and a recognition of the limited shortlist of candidates.

In contrast to his support for Warsh, Dimon has not publicly endorsed other Fed chair candidates, such as Janet Yellen or Ben Bernanke, in the past. A review of major news outlets, including Reuters, Bloomberg, and the Financial Times, found no instances of Dimon explicitly backing Yellen or Bernanke for the Fed chairmanship. This makes Dimon's endorsement of Warsh unique and explicit, with implications for market perception and the potential direction of US monetary policy.

The quantitative evidence supports the notion that a Warsh chairmanship could lead to slower GDP growth. Under a plausible tightening path, with 75 basis points of rate hikes in the first year, US GDP growth could be cut by roughly 0.45 percentage points, moving the economy from a modest expansion to a slower-growth environment. The empirical link between rate hikes and GDP growth, as estimated by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, suggests that each 25-basis-point increase in the federal-funds rate reduces GDP growth by approximately 0.15 percentage points.

In conclusion, Jamie Dimon's endorsement of Kevin Warsh is significant, given the potential implications of a Warsh chairmanship on US monetary policy and GDP growth. While the industry's reaction is mixed, with other executives emphasizing the importance of Fed independence, Dimon's support for Warsh is unique and explicit. As the data suggests, a Warsh chairmanship could lead to slower GDP growth, and the market will be closely watching the Fed's next moves.
