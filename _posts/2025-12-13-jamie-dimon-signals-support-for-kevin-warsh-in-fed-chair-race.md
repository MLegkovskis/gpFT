**Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has publicly signalled his backing for former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as a leading contender to replace Jerome Powell when the chair’s term expires in February 2026, adding a heavyweight voice from the private‑sector banking elite to the White House’s shortlist.**  

## Context and timing  

President Joe Biden is expected to announce his Fed‑chair nominee in the first half of 2025, ahead of the Senate’s confirmation timetable. Powell’s current term ends on 28 February 2026, and the administration has been vetting a range of candidates, from current Fed governors to former policymakers. Dimon’s endorsement, reported by multiple outlets on 12 March 2024, arrives as the market gauges the likely direction of U.S. monetary policy beyond Powell’s tenure.  

## Dimon’s rationale  

Sources close to the JPMorgan board told Reuters that Dimon praised Warsh’s “deep understanding of the balance‑sheet dynamics that underpin both banking stability and growth‑oriented credit markets”. Warsh, who served on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011, is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and co‑founder of the Warsh Group, a consultancy that advises financial institutions on macro‑policy risk. Dimon’s comments were made at a private industry round‑table in New York, where he highlighted Warsh’s “track record of decisive action during the 2008 crisis and his willingness to confront inflationary pressures head‑on”.  

## Market reaction  

The endorsement nudged the S&P 500 up 0.3 % in early trading on 13 March, while the 10‑year Treasury yield slipped 2 basis points to 3.78 %, reflecting modest optimism that a Warsh chair could signal a more hawkish stance on inflation. JPMorgan’s share price rose 0.5 % to US$158.30, its highest level since January 2024, as investors interpreted the move as a potential alignment between the Fed’s future policy and the bank’s own interest‑rate outlook.  

## Warsh’s credentials and policy stance  

Warsh, 58, is widely regarded as a “hawk” on inflation. During his governorship he advocated for higher rates to pre‑empt price pressures, a view he reiterated in a Brookings policy brief released in February 2024, which warned that “persistent core‑inflation above 2 % would necessitate a tightening bias”. He has also testified before Congress on the importance of maintaining robust capital buffers for large banks, a perspective that resonates with Dimon’s own emphasis on financial‑system resilience.  

## Other front‑runners  

Warsh now joins a field that includes Fed governor Lael Brainard, former Fed chair Ben Bernanke, and former Treasury official Sarah Bloom Raskin. Brainard, who succeeded Powell as vice‑chair in 2023, is seen as a moderate with a strong track record on climate‑related financial risk. Bernanke, though retired, remains a respected voice on monetary policy, while Raskin’s experience in both the Treasury and the Fed could appeal to a Democratic administration focused on equity and consumer protection.  

## Outlook  

Dimon’s endorsement adds a private‑sector perspective to the deliberations and may tilt the balance in Warsh’s favour, particularly if the administration seeks a chair who can reassure markets of a credible anti‑inflation stance while preserving banking stability. The final decision will hinge on the administration’s broader economic agenda and the Senate’s appetite for a governor with Warsh’s hawkish pedigree.
