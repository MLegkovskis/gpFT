**Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has publicly backed former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as a leading contender to replace Jerome Powell when his term ends in February 2026, a move that could tilt the Biden administration’s shortlist and influence market expectations of future monetary policy.**  

## Background to the Fed chair succession  

Jerome Powell’s eight‑year tenure is set to conclude on 5 February 2026. The White House, which must nominate a successor by the end of 2025, has so far kept its list confidential, but Reuters and Bloomberg have identified three primary groups of candidates: current Fed governors (notably Lael Brainard and Philip Jefferson), senior Treasury officials, and external technocrats such as Kevin Warsh, a former governor (2006‑2011) who now chairs the advisory board of the private‑equity firm Warburg Pincus.  

## Dimon’s endorsement of Warsh  

During a private conference call with senior JPMorgan executives on 11 October 2024, Dimon praised Warsh’s “deep understanding of the balance‑sheet approach” and “ability to navigate a tightening cycle without destabilising growth”. The comment was reported by Bloomberg on 12 October and subsequently confirmed by a JPMorgan spokesperson, who said the bank “believes Warsh would provide the steady‑hand leadership needed as the economy transitions from pandemic‑era stimulus to a more normal monetary stance”.  

## Market reaction  

The endorsement triggered a modest but measurable shift in market pricing. The 10‑year Treasury yield fell 4 basis points to 4.12 % on 12 October, while the S&P 500 edged up 0.3 % to 5 450 points, reflecting investor optimism that a Warsh chair might adopt a more gradual rate‑hiking trajectory. Currency markets saw the dollar dip 0.2 % against the euro, and the Bloomberg US Dollar Index slipped to 102.5.  

## Candidate field and timeline  

- **Kevin Warsh** – former Fed governor, now private‑sector adviser; supported by Dimon and several Wall Street CEOs.  
- **Lael Brainard** – current Fed governor, former Treasury deputy secretary; widely regarded as the administration’s favourite.  
- **Philip Jefferson** – Fed governor, former Fed board member; gaining traction after recent speeches on inflation targeting.  
- **Janet Yellen** – Treasury secretary, occasionally floated as a caretaker nominee.  

The White House is expected to release a shortlist by late December 2024, with a formal nomination due by 31 December 2025.  

## Outlook  

Dimon’s backing adds a high‑profile private‑sector voice to Warsh’s candidacy, potentially reshaping the calculus of both the administration and market participants. Should Warsh secure the nomination, analysts anticipate a modestly dovish tilt in policy forecasts, with the Federal Open Market Committee likely to pause rate hikes in early 2025 before resuming a data‑dependent path.
