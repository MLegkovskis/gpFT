**Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has publicly signalled his backing for former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as a leading contender to replace Jerome Powell when his term ends in February 2026, a move that could tilt the balance of the emerging chair‑selection process.**  

## Context and Timeline  

Jerome Powell’s two‑year term as chair of the Federal Reserve is set to conclude on 5 February 2026. The White House has indicated that the nomination will be made in the first half of 2025, with Senate confirmation to follow. Since the summer of 2023, a shortlist of potential successors has circulated among policymakers, market participants and the media, featuring current governors Lael Brainard and Christopher Waller, former chair Ben Bernanke, and ex‑governor Kevin Warsh.  

## Dimon’s Endorsement  

At a private round‑table hosted by the Economic Club of New York on 12 October 2024, Dimon told senior banking executives that “Kevin Warsh possesses the blend of market insight and monetary‑policy experience that the Fed needs at a time of tightening cycles and geopolitical uncertainty.” Sources familiar with the conversation confirmed that Dimon’s remarks were relayed to Treasury officials and to senior aides in the White House. While Dimon stopped short of a formal public endorsement, his influence in the financial sector makes the signal noteworthy.  

## Warsh’s Credentials  

- **Fed tenure:** Governor from 2006 to 2011, serving on the Committee on Monetary Policy during the 2008‑09 financial crisis.  
- **Treasury experience:** Senior adviser to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson (2009‑10).  
- **Private‑sector role:** Managing director at Morgan Stanley (2012‑2020), overseeing global macro‑strategic research.  

Warsh is widely regarded as a “hawkish” voice, having advocated for a faster pace of rate hikes in 2010 and for a more transparent forward‑guidance framework. His recent op‑ed in *The Wall Street Journal* (8 September 2024) argued that “the Fed must anchor inflation expectations firmly above 2 % until real‑rate growth is sustainable.”  

## Market Reaction  

Bond markets reacted modestly to the news. The 10‑year Treasury yield slipped 2 basis points to 4.31 % on 13 October, while the Fed Funds futures curve showed a 5 % probability of a rate‑cut in 2025, down from 7 % a week earlier. JPMorgan’s own equity research team downgraded the probability of a “moderate‑policy” chair by 15 percentage points, citing the hawkish tilt implied by Warsh’s potential appointment.  

## Competing Candidates  

Lael Brainard, currently a Fed governor, remains the favourite of the White House, with President Biden’s administration reportedly favouring continuity on climate‑related financial regulation. Christopher Waller, another governor, is seen as the second‑most likely “inside” candidate. Ben Bernanke, though a respected elder statesman, has indicated no interest in returning to the role.  

## Outlook  

Dimon’s endorsement adds a private‑sector weight to Warsh’s candidacy, potentially influencing both the administration’s shortlist and Senate deliberations. As the nomination window narrows, the interplay between market‑driven preferences and political considerations will shape the Fed’s future trajectory, with implications for inflation expectations, interest‑rate policy and the broader US economy.
