**Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has publicly backed former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as a leading contender to replace Jerome Powell, a move that could reshape the emerging field of candidates for the U.S. central‑bank chairmanship.** Dimon’s endorsement, delivered at the Financial Services Forum in New York on 12 October 2024, signals strong backing from the nation’s most influential banking chief and adds weight to Warsh’s profile ahead of the Biden administration’s expected nomination later this year.

## Context of the Fed chair succession

Jerome Powell’s term expires in February 2026, and the White House is expected to announce a successor in the first half of 2025. The race has already featured a handful of high‑profile names, but Warsh’s candidacy has gained renewed momentum after Dimon’s remarks. Warsh served on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011, where he was known for advocating a more hawkish stance on inflation and for supporting the gradual unwinding of the quantitative‑easing programme.

## Dimon’s endorsement and Warsh’s credentials

Speaking to a panel of senior bankers, Dimon said: “Kevin Warsh brings a rare blend of monetary‑policy experience and private‑sector insight that would be valuable at a time when the Fed must navigate a post‑pandemic economy with persistent price pressures.” Dimon highlighted Warsh’s track record of steering the Fed through the 2008 financial crisis and his subsequent work at Warburg Pincus, where he oversaw infrastructure‑focused investments.

Warsh, now 58, also served as a senior adviser at the U.S. Treasury under President George W. Bush and has been a frequent commentator on monetary policy at think‑tanks such as the Brookings Institution. His recent op‑ed in *The Wall Street Journal* (dated 9 Oct 2024) called for a “clear, data‑driven path to 2 % inflation by mid‑2025,” echoing the stance Dimon praised.

## Market reaction

Within hours of Dimon’s comments, the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index rose 0.2 %, while the 10‑year Treasury yield slipped from 4.38 % to 4.33 %. The S&P 500 edged up 0.3 % as investors interpreted the endorsement as a signal of potential policy continuity. Analysts at Goldman Sachs noted that “a Warsh chair could temper the Fed’s recent dovish tilt, which may be reflected in modestly higher rates over the next 12 months.”

## Other front‑runners

Warsh now joins a shortlist that still includes:
- **Lael Brainard**, current Vice‑Chair of the Fed, widely regarded as the administration’s favourite.
- **Sarah Bloom Raskin**, former Fed governor and current Treasury deputy secretary.
- **Mark Zandi**, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, who has been floated as a technocratic alternative.

## Outlook

The final decision will rest with President Joe Biden and Senate confirmation. Dimon’s endorsement adds a powerful private‑sector voice to Warsh’s dossier, but the administration is likely to weigh political considerations, including the need for a chair who can command bipartisan support in a closely divided Senate. As the nomination window narrows, the Fed chair race will remain a focal point for both markets and policymakers, with the eventual appointee set to steer U.S. monetary policy through a pivotal period of inflation moderation and fiscal consolidation.
