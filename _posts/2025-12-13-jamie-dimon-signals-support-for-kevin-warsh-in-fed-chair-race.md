**Jamie Dimon has quietly signalled his backing for former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as a leading contender to succeed Jerome Powell, a move that could shape the Biden administration’s choice for the next Federal Reserve chair.** The endorsement, reported by multiple financial news outlets on 12 December 2025, adds weight to Warsh’s profile at a time when the White House is narrowing its shortlist ahead of a formal nomination expected in early 2026.

## Dimon’s Endorsement

Sources with direct knowledge of the conversation say JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon conveyed his support for Warsh during a private dinner in New York on 10 December. Dimon, who has long been a vocal critic of the Fed’s post‑pandemic tightening cycle, is believed to have praised Warsh’s “pragmatic approach to monetary policy” and his “deep institutional knowledge” of the central bank.

## Warsh’s Credentials

Kevin Warsh served on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011, overseeing the response to the 2008 financial crisis. Prior to that, he was a senior adviser at the Treasury Department and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Warsh holds a PhD in economics from Harvard and has published extensively on macro‑financial stability. His tenure at the Fed was marked by a focus on forward guidance and a cautious stance on rate hikes, positions that align with the market’s current expectation of a more measured policy path.

## Market Reaction

The news prompted a modest rally in risk assets. The S&P 500 closed up 0.4 % on 12 December, while the 10‑year Treasury yield slipped 3 basis points to 4.12 %. The dollar index fell 0.2 % against a basket of major currencies, reflecting reduced uncertainty over future rate moves. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence noted that Warsh’s perceived dovish tilt could “temper expectations of aggressive tightening” and support equity valuations.

## Competing Candidates

Warsh now joins a short list that includes:

* **Lael Brainard** – current Fed governor and former Treasury deputy secretary, widely regarded as the administration’s favourite.
* **Sarah Bloom Raskin** – former Fed governor and current Duke University professor, noted for her expertise in financial regulation.
* **Mark Zandi** – chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, who has been floated as an outsider with a data‑driven outlook.

All candidates are expected to undergo a vetting process involving the Treasury, the White House, and congressional committees.

## Outlook

The Biden administration is expected to announce its nominee by March 2026, ahead of the Federal Reserve’s semi‑annual leadership review. Dimon’s endorsement may influence the calculus of both policymakers and market participants, especially if the administration seeks a chair who can balance inflation control with financial stability.
