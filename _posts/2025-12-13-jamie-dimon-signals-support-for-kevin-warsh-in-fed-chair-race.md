**Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has publicly backed former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as a leading contender to replace Jerome Powell as chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, a endorsement that could tilt the balance in a tightly contested selection process.**  

## Context and Timing  

Jerome Powell’s term expires in February 2026, and the White House is expected to nominate a successor in the first half of 2026. The race has already attracted attention from both parties: former President Donald Trump signalled a preference for either Warsh or National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, while the Biden administration has hinted at a more dovish tilt. Dimon’s comments were made on 12 December 2025 at JPMorgan’s private conference for asset‑management CEOs in New York, a forum that routinely draws senior policymakers and market leaders.  

## Dimon’s Assessment  

Speaking to the audience, Dimon said Warsh “would make a great chairman” and praised his “credibility‑first, hawkish” approach to monetary policy. By contrast, Dimon described Hassett as “the candidate more likely to cut rates in the short term,” suggesting a clear distinction between Warsh’s inflation‑focused stance and Hassett’s growth‑oriented outlook. Dimon’s remarks carry weight: JPMorgan is the United States’ largest bank by assets (£3.7 trillion) and its CEO is a frequent adviser to Treasury officials.  

## Warsh’s Credentials  

Kevin Warsh served on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011, overseeing the policy response to the 2008 financial crisis. Prior to that, he was a senior Treasury official under President George W. Bush and later a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. Warsh is known for advocating a “rules‑based” policy framework and for warning against premature rate cuts that could reignite inflation.  

## Market Reaction  

Within hours of the news, the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index slipped 4 basis points, while the 2‑year Treasury yield edged up to 5.12 %, its highest level since March 2023. Analysts at Goldman Sachs noted that “Dimon’s endorsement adds a credible, market‑friendly voice to Warsh’s candidacy, which could reassure investors seeking a steady‑hand on inflation.”  

## Other Contenders  

The shortlist also includes Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who is widely regarded as a moderate, and former Treasury deputy secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin, noted for her experience in financial regulation. Both are favoured by senior Democratic officials, but have not yet received public backing from major Wall Street figures.  

## Implications  

If Warsh secures the chair, the Fed is likely to maintain a tighter policy stance, prioritising price stability over rapid rate cuts. That would align with Dimon’s view that “credibility” is essential for market confidence. Conversely, a Hassett appointment could accelerate rate reductions, potentially boosting equity valuations but risking inflationary pressure.  

The final decision will rest with the President and the Senate, but Dimon’s endorsement has undeniably sharpened the focus on Warsh as a serious, hawkish alternative in the Fed chair race.
