The American automotive industry is poised for a significant shift in the coming quarter, with major carmakers like General Motors (GM), Ford Motor Co., and Stellantis providing guidance on their projected revenue numbers. GM is banking on a rebound in high-margin trucks and large SUVs, targeting $10.3-$11.7 billion in total 2026 revenue, which translates to $2.58-$2.93 billion for the upcoming quarter. Ford, on the other hand, is projecting $158 billion in total 2026 revenue, with $8-$10 billion in adjusted EBIT, driven by growth in its Ford Pro services and Ford Energy battery-storage business. This implies a Q2 2026 revenue of approximately $39.5 billion. Stellantis, the other major US-based automaker, expects US sales of nearly 16 million units in 2026, which would result in an estimated $180 billion in quarterly revenue if 2025 pricing holds. While these projections indicate a positive outlook for the industry, the shift to electric vehicles and potential disruptions in the automotive industry could impact stock prices and the US GDP. However, with the provided data, the overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a focus on the potential for growth and increased revenue in the coming quarter.
