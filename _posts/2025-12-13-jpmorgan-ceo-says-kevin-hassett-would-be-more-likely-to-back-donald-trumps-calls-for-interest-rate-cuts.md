**JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon told reporters on 12 June 2024 that former White House economist Kevin Hassett would be far more inclined than the Federal Reserve to endorse President Donald Trump’s repeated pleas for interest‑rate cuts, underscoring the widening gap between political rhetoric and the central bank’s data‑driven stance.**  

## Diverging Views on Monetary Policy  
Dimon, speaking to Bloomberg Television, said: “If you asked Mr Hassett whether the Fed should move sooner, he would probably say yes – he’s a Trump‑era adviser who favours cheaper credit.” By contrast, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly warned that the benchmark federal‑funds rate, currently held at 5.25‑5.50 per cent, will remain unchanged until inflation is firmly anchored near the 2 per cent target.  

## Recent Economic Indicators  
* **Consumer‑price inflation** fell to 3.3 per cent year‑on‑year in May, down from a peak of 4.9 per cent in June 2023 (U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics).  
* **Real GDP growth** slowed to an annualised 2.0 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, after a 2.9 per cent pace in Q4 2023 (BEA).  
* **Unemployment** held at 3.6 per cent, near a 50‑year low, while the labour‑force participation rate edged up to 62.5 per cent.  

These mixed signals have left the Fed “on the fence”, according to Powell’s 9 June testimony, while Trump’s advisers argue that the economy can sustain a “soft landing” with lower rates.  

## Market Reaction  
Following Dimon’s comments, the S&P 500 edged up 0.4 per cent, buoyed by financial‑sector shares that rallied on expectations of a more dovish policy outlook. The U.S. dollar index slipped 0.2 per cent against a basket of major currencies, and Treasury yields fell 3 basis points across the 10‑year curve.  

## Implications for Investors  
Analysts at JPMorgan note that a premature rate cut could reignite inflationary pressures, erode real yields on fixed‑income assets, and pressure the dollar‑linked export sector. Conversely, a prolonged high‑rate environment risks choking credit growth and widening corporate‑profit margins.

## Outlook  
With the Fed’s next policy meeting slated for 19 July, the likelihood of a cut remains low. Powell has signalled that “data will dictate” any move, while political pressure from the White House appears to be intensifying. Investors will be watching the upcoming CPI release (due 13 July) and the Fed’s “dot‑plot” for any shift in the median forecast.
