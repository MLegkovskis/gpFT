# The Big Read: What Fast Food’s Downturn Says About the US Economy
The US fast-food industry is facing a significant downturn, with sales falling 4-5% year-over-year (YoY) in Q2 2025. This decline is not only a symptom of a broader economic trend but also a driver of the US GDP growth slowdown. 
## Key Statistics:
* US fast-food industry revenue: $300bn (≈ 1.5% of US GDP)
* Year-over-year same-store sales decline: -4.2% (overall fast-food segment)
* Fast-casual chains: Cava same-store growth +2.1% (Q2 2025) vs +12% (Q1 2025)
* Chipotle sales: -4% YoY (Q2 2025) and -50% share price loss in 2025
## Impact on US GDP:
* Consumer-spending shock absorber: A 3-4% drop in the food-away-from-home sub-sector (≈ $10-12bn) directly trims the 70% consumer-spending component of GDP, shaving 0.3-0.4 percentage points off overall growth.
* K-shaped spending pattern: Lower-income households are cutting back on restaurant spending, while higher-income consumers are shifting to premium or home-cooked meals.
## Conclusion:
The decline in fast-food sales reflects a broader economic trend, with lower-income households feeling the strain. As the fast-food industry continues to struggle, it may have a ripple effect on the overall US GDP growth.
