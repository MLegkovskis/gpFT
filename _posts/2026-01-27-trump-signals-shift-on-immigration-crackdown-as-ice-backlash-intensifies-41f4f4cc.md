# Trump Signals Shift on Immigration Crackdown
Former President Donald Trump has indicated a willingness to reassess his administration's immigration crackdown strategy, particularly in Minneapolis. The potential shift in policy comes amid growing backlash against ICE actions, including two fatal shootings in January 2026.
## Policies Under Consideration
Trump is reportedly considering several changes to his immigration policies, including:
* Scaling back ICE presence in Minneapolis
* Pausing or 're-calibrating' the Minneapolis immigration crackdown
* Shifting focus from broad sweeps to violent-criminal enforcement
* Appointing a 'border czar' to oversee ICE operations in Minneapolis
## Expected Impact on ICE Operations
The proposed changes could have significant implications for current ICE operations, including:
* A reduction in daily raids and arrest counts in the Minneapolis metro area
* Re-allocation of resources to other priority regions or violent-criminal cases
* Limiting ICE's exposure to civil suits stemming from recent fatal shootings
* Improving inter-governmental relations with state and local officials
## Key Dates and Numbers
Several key events have contributed to the potential shift in Trump's immigration stance, including:
* January 12, 2026: First fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by ICE in 2026
* January 26, 2026: Second fatal shooting, prompting Trump's phone call with Governor Tim Walz
* January 26, 2026: Trump announces the appointment of Tom Homan as 'border czar'
## Representative Quotes
Several individuals have commented on the potential shift in Trump's immigration policies, including:
* Donald Trump: 'I'm sending my border czar, Tom Homan, to Minneapolis and I'm open to reducing the number of federal immigration agents operating there and focusing on violent criminals.'
* Governor Tim Walz: 'The conversation was productive. We need to pause the immigration crackdown while we sort out these tragedies.'
* Republican strategist Alex Patton: 'Trump's immigration agenda is becoming a liability… you can't have ICE shooting citizens on camera and then try to spin that as law and order.'
