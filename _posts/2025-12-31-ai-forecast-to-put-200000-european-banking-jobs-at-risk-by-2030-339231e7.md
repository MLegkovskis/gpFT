**AI forecast to put 200,000 European banking jobs at risk by 2030**

The latest modelling by McKinsey‑GMI, echoed by Citigroup and Bloomberg Intelligence, suggests that up to 200,000 positions – roughly 3.4 % of the European banking workforce – could be displaced by artificial intelligence by the end of the decade. Executives and regulators alike are warning that the scale of the shift will test the sector’s resilience, prompting a wave of reskilling programmes, mandatory reporting and new macro‑prudential safeguards.

Bank leaders have been quick to acknowledge the magnitude of the challenge while insisting that the outcome need not be pure job loss. Maria Torres, head of European Banking Strategy at Citigroup, confirmed the 200,000‑job figure and called for “targeted reskilling programmes” and “process‑re‑engineering” to preserve productivity gains. ING’s chief executive, Steven van Rijswijk, softened the headline by speaking of “transformation” rather than elimination, estimating that 150,000 roles could be redeployed rather than cut. HCLTech’s Sudip Lahiri, citing Bloomberg Intelligence, added that banks expect a net staff reduction of about 3 % by 2030, with the most aggressive scenarios projecting cuts of 5‑10 %.

Regulators have moved swiftly to embed the employment dimension into their supervisory frameworks. The European Banking Authority (EBA) introduced AI‑ML Guidelines in September 2024, urging banks to map AI‑induced staffing impacts and to develop talent‑management plans. Its subsequent AI‑Employment‑Impact‑Report (October 2024) warned that, without mitigation, AI could affect up to 180,000 jobs and recommended that banks allocate at least 2 % of operating expenses to mandatory reskilling budgets. Deputy Chair Elisa Franz reiterated that large‑scale automation will be monitored as a systemic risk, while Chair Andrea Enria highlighted the dual reality of displacement and new skill‑requirements.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has added another layer of oversight. In its June 2025 Supervision Newsletter on AI, Head of Supervision Fabio Caruana stressed that AI adoption must be paired with robust governance and that workforce‑impact assessments will now form part of the AI risk‑framework. National supervisors are echoing the concern. Steven Maijoor, chair of supervision at De Nederlandsche Bank, warned that deeper AI use could increase reliance on non‑EU technology providers, raising both systemic and data‑sovereignty risks.

Despite the bleak headline, some voices see a net‑positive outlook if policy keeps pace with technology. Michele Bianchi of the European Investment Bank argued in June 2024 that AI will create more jobs across the financial ecosystem than it destroys, provided continuous learning is funded. The European Skills Agenda, already earmarked for upskilling funds, could become the engine that transforms the projected 200,000‑job displacement into a catalyst for a more digitally proficient workforce.

The convergence of independent forecasts – McKinsey‑GMI, Bloomberg Intelligence and Citigroup – on a 200,000‑job impact underscores the urgency of coordinated action. Banks are already budgeting for AI‑driven productivity gains of 2‑3 % while earmarking at least 2 % of operating budgets for talent development. Regulators, meanwhile, are treating large‑scale automation as a macro‑prudential issue, demanding transparent reporting and mandatory reskilling plans. The coming years will reveal whether Europe can preserve its distinctive “European model” of banking employment while harnessing AI’s efficiency promise.
