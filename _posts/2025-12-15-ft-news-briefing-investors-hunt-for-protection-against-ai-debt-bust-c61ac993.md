**Investors are scrambling for safe‑haven assets as AI‑linked investment‑grade bonds swell to roughly $1.3 trillion – about 14 % of the whole IG market – and the spectre of a sector‑wide debt bust looms.** The surge, driven by $570 billion of projected cap‑ex from the “Magnificent 7” tech giants, has already added 0.9 percentage points to U.S. growth and 0.6 pp to the euro‑zone in the first half of 2025, but analysts warn that a reversal could erase a full point of GDP growth across advanced economies.

The scale of the exposure is unprecedented since the early‑2000s dot‑com bond boom. JPMorgan’s AI Debt Index records a 45 % jump in issuance over the past twelve months, while alternative industry estimates put AI‑related IG debt at $1.2 trillion, representing 14 % of the market. Quarterly issuance now averages $100 billion, and private‑credit forecasts see another $800 billion flowing into AI projects over the next two years. Such credit‑heavy financing differs sharply from the equity‑driven hype of the late‑1990s, placing banks, pension funds and sovereign investors directly in the line of fire.

“​We are seeing a classic ‘debt‑busting’ cycle where the hype around AI is now translating into real credit risk,” warned Sarah Miller, senior credit analyst at Barclays. BlackRock’s fixed‑income chief David Chen added that “investors are scrambling for protection, moving into sovereign bonds and high‑quality corporates as AI‑linked issuance swells to unprecedented levels.” HSBC chief economist Markus Feld cautioned that “if AI‑related earnings fail to materialise, the sector’s debt load could trigger a broader credit‑market correction, eroding the modest growth boost we have seen this year.”

Even the most bullish voices flag the danger. Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, speaking on CNN in June, likened the confluence of soaring U.S. debt (a record 123 % debt‑to‑GDP ratio) and AI‑fuelled borrowing to a “death‑spiral” that could unfold over the long term. In a Fortune interview in November he noted that AI‑related high‑grade corporate debt now exceeds $1.2 trillion, “larger than debt tied to banks,” and warned that “when you are in that territory you get very low returns.” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has repeatedly warned that “a crack in the bond market is going to happen – the size of the debt load makes it almost certain,” pointing to the same $1.2 trillion AI exposure as a catalyst for stress in the sovereign market.

The macro picture is mixed. IMF‑World Bank joint analysis attributes 0.9 pp of U.S. H1‑2025 growth and 0.6 pp of euro‑zone growth to AI‑driven spending, while the United Kingdom saw a 0.4 pp lift in Q2‑2025 and China a 0.3 pp boost. Yet the same analysis warns that a downturn in AI earnings could strip 1 – 1.5 pp from growth, a hit comparable to the output loss that followed the 2008 sub‑prime collapse.

Comparisons with past crises sharpen the warning. The dot‑com bust was largely equity‑based; its $70 billion venture‑capital peak erased roughly $6 trillion in household wealth but left the banking system largely untouched. By contrast, the AI debt build‑up is credit‑focused, with quarterly bond issuance dwarfing the pre‑2000 tech borrowing and mirroring the sub‑prime exposure that precipitated the 2008 crisis. If defaults materialise, the $800 billion to $1 trillion of AI‑linked credit could spark a liquidity crunch across pension funds, sovereign balance sheets and private‑credit markets.

For investors, the message is clear: hedge now. Short‑duration Treasuries, high‑quality sovereigns and inflation‑linked assets such as gold are gaining favour, while exposure to AI‑linked bonds should be carefully calibrated against the looming credit risk. The sector’s long‑term productivity promise – an estimated 0.5‑2 % annual GDP gain – remains attractive, but only if the debt that underpins it can be serviced without destabilising the broader financial system.
