# Explainer. How would Donald Trump tap ‘tremendous’ wealth from Venezuelan oil?

**Donald Trump’s proposal to revive Venezuela’s oil sector hinges on turning a resource worth between $18 trillion and $45 trillion on paper into a stream of roughly $70‑$80 billion of annual revenue, potentially doubling the country’s $82 billion GDP within a decade.** The plan would require an upfront investment of about $100 billion to lift output from the current one‑million barrels per day to a target of four million barrels per day, a scale‑up that would add roughly 1.1 billion barrels of crude each year.

The baseline picture is stark. Venezuela’s proven reserves – about 303 billion barrels of conventional and heavy crude – constitute the world’s largest single reserve, while the broader technically recoverable figure reaches 380‑652 billion barrels. At a mid‑range market price of $70 per barrel, the in‑ground value of the proven reserve alone is roughly $21 trillion; at peak‑cycle prices of $150 per barrel the figure swells to $45 trillion, and at lower‑cycle $60 per barrel it falls to $18 trillion. Yet the country’s economy remains tiny: IMF estimates placed 2022 GDP at $82.1 billion, with per‑capita output barely $3,050.

Capital Economics outlines the financial mechanics of a US‑backed extraction drive. Raising production to four million barrels per day would demand about $100 billion in capital over ten years, covering the reconstruction of refineries, pipelines and power infrastructure that have deteriorated under sanctions. The incremental output – an extra three million barrels per day – translates to roughly 1.1 billion barrels annually. At $70 a barrel that yields $77 billion of gross revenue each year. If the bulk of that cash stayed in the Venezuelan economy, GDP could climb to around $150 billion, an 80‑90 % surge. Even after deducting the $100 billion investment, the net boost would still be on the order of $50 billion per annum, enough to lift the nation out of its prolonged recession.

Analysts, however, temper the optimism with hard‑nosed feasibility assessments. The infrastructure gap alone is estimated at $20‑$60 billion, with ADI Analytics noting that restoring pre‑2014 capacity could cost up to $20 billion, while broader brownfield rebuilds may require $10‑$60 billion over five years. Political and legal risk further clouds the picture: U.S. sanctions were briefly lifted in May 2025 only to be reinstated in July, and outstanding arbitration awards – $1 billion from ExxonMobil and $10 billion from ConocoPhillips – remain unresolved. Chevron, the sole U.S. major still operating in Venezuela, produces about 250,000 barrels per day, representing roughly 2 % of its total revenue, and would stand to benefit most from any reopening. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips have signalled they would wait for a “clear, stable fiscal terms and a credible legal framework” before committing capital.

From a market perspective, even a modest increase in Venezuelan output would have limited global impact. Doubling production to two million barrels per day would raise world supply by only 0.5 %, shaving $2‑$4 per barrel off Brent. Nonetheless, a sustained flow of 500‑600 k barrels per day of extra‑heavy crude could bolster U.S. Gulf Coast refineries, reducing reliance on Middle Eastern imports and providing a modest downward pressure on global oil prices.

In sum, Trump’s vision of “tremendous” wealth rests on converting a trillion‑dollar‑scale in‑ground asset into a tangible economic engine. The arithmetic is compelling: $70‑$80 billion of annual oil revenue against a $100 billion capital outlay, with the potential to double GDP within ten years. Yet the path is strewn with capital intensity, a decade‑long reconstruction timetable, and entrenched geopolitical and legal obstacles. The ultimate payoff will depend not only on engineering the lift in production but also on securing a stable contractual regime that convinces U.S. majors to pour money into a country still wrestling with sanctions and debt.
