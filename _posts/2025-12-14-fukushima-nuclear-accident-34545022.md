**The March 2011 Fukushima Daiichi disaster set in motion a cascade of political, corporate and market upheavals that continue to shape Japan’s energy landscape and global nuclear policy. Prime Minister Naoto Kan’s on‑site visit and his demand that top executives share the burden of sacrifice highlighted early governmental frustration with TEPCO’s communication failures, while the subsequent testimony in 2017 cemented his view that nuclear power could not be trusted without an “absolute safety culture”. TEPCO’s board, meanwhile, issued a public pledge to protect the public, only to be later condemned as having engineered a “profoundly man‑made disaster” and to face criminal prosecution – a case that ended in acquittal in 2023, leaving civil liability unresolved.** 

The accident’s immediate human toll was stark: more than 300,000 people were evacuated, 19,759 deaths were recorded across the combined earthquake‑tsunami‑nuclear event and 138,000 buildings were destroyed. Economically, the disaster has been priced at roughly ¥20 trillion (≈ US $180 billion), equivalent to about 3 % of Japan’s annual GDP. If the cleanup and compensation costs are spread evenly over a ten‑year horizon, the quarterly burden for the next quarter is estimated at ¥0.5 trillion (≈ US $4.5 billion), a modest slice of the roughly ¥1.55 trillion quarterly GDP but contributing to the 0.6 % contraction observed in Q3 2025. 

Globally, the shock reverberated through energy markets. Japan shut down all 54 of its reactors by May 2011, and by 2025 only nine have been restarted, driving a decline in worldwide nuclear capacity from 393 GW in 2010 to about 360 GW. The loss of nuclear generation forced Japan to increase oil imports from roughly 2.5 Mt in 2010 to 3.2 Mt by the end of 2012, a level that has persisted, adding roughly ¥1.2 trillion to the nation’s energy trade deficit. Spot crude prices spiked to $115 per barrel in mid‑March 2011, underscoring the market’s sensitivity to supply disruptions. 

In response, the Japanese government rolled out a ¥2 trillion subsidy package for solar and wind in 2012. The policy shift has borne fruit: renewable sources now supply about 30 % of Japan’s electricity, up from 7 % a decade earlier, with solar capacity expanding from 3 GW in 2010 to roughly 45 GW in 2025. Equity markets also felt the tremor; nuclear‑related stocks such as Électricité de France and Westinghouse fell 12‑18 % in the week after the disaster, and although they have recovered, the sector’s market capitalisation remains about 15 % below pre‑crisis levels. 

Comparing the nuclear accident with the broader 2011 Tōhoku earthquake‑tsunami underscores the added radiological dimension. The natural disaster, a magnitude‑9.0 quake that generated a 39.7 m tsunami, claimed over 22 000 lives and inflicted $157.5 billion in damage, but produced no radioactive fallout. Fukushima’s nuclear failure released iodine‑131, cesium‑134 and cesium‑137 into the atmosphere and ocean, prompting an initial 2‑km evacuation radius that quickly expanded to a 20‑km mandatory zone and a 30‑km exclusion area where annual doses exceeded 50 mSv. While the tsunami‑driven evacuations affected roughly 470 000 people temporarily, the nuclear zone displaced about 160 000 residents, with long‑term restrictions persisting in parts of the 30‑km exclusion zone as of 2025. The radiological contamination has lingered in soil, forest, food chains and even across the Pacific, a legacy absent from the natural disaster’s aftermath. 

The Fukushima episode thus illustrates how a single technological failure can amplify a natural catastrophe, reshaping national policy, corporate accountability and global energy markets for years to come.
