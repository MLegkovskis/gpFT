**Delivery Hero Backs CEO While Exploring Sales Under Investor Pressure**
================================================================================

**The food delivery company's board has reaffirmed its support for CEO Niklas Östberg, despite calls from major investors such as Prosus (Naspers) to consider a sale or spin-off to unlock value.** The move comes as Delivery Hero's share price has underperformed its peers, with the stock currently trading at €115, down from its 52-week high. The company has been expanding its services, including the launch of its "Kitchen as a Service" (KaaS) pilot in Berlin and grocery-delivery pilots in Brazil and Mexico.

Since its IPO in 2017, Delivery Hero has undergone significant strategic shifts, from a pure online-food-marketplace to a platform that builds its own delivery fleet. The company has also made several key acquisitions, including Foodpanda and Zomato Media, to accelerate its growth. Under Östberg's leadership, Delivery Hero has expanded into new geographies and verticals, including grocery and quick-commerce. The company has also launched its KaaS platform, which aims to provide a logistics backbone for restaurants, supermarkets, and other partners.

Major investors, such as Insight Venture Partners and Naspers, have publicly expressed their support for Östberg and the company's growth strategy. However, activist investors like Sachem Head and Aspex Management have been pushing for a sale or divestment of non-core assets to maximize shareholder value. Sachem Head, which holds a 3.6% stake in the company, has explicitly stated its willingness to consider a change of leadership to unlock value. Aspex Management, with a stake of over 5%, has publicly urged the board to explore a sale of the whole company or of non-core assets.

The company's leadership and strategy have evolved significantly since its IPO. In 2017, Delivery Hero launched its IPO, raising €989 million at €25.50 per share, with a market capitalization of €4.63 billion. The company had 6,000 employees and served over 40 countries. In 2018, Delivery Hero entered the MDAX index after rapid post-IPO growth, accelerating its M&A activity with the acquisition of Foodpanda and deliveras.gr. In 2019, Östberg steered the acquisition of Zomato Media to enter India and the UAE, expanding the company's presence in new geographies and verticals.

In recent years, Delivery Hero has shifted its focus towards profitability, with the company's EBITDA margin improving from -12% in 2020 to -5% in 2022. The company has also divested non-core assets, such as Foodpanda India, to focus on its core business. Despite these efforts, the company's share price has underperformed its peers, leading to increased pressure from investors to consider a sale or spin-off.

According to Östberg, "We are focused on profitability and sustainable growth, expanding our grocery and quick-commerce verticals, and scaling the Kitchen-as-a-Service platform." The company has approximately 50,000 couriers in over 50 markets, with a presence in countries across the globe. In an interview with Reuters, Östberg emphasized the importance of building a logistics backbone that can serve restaurants, supermarkets, and other partners.
