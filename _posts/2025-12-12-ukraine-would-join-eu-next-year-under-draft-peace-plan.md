**Ukraine could become an EU member by 1 January 2027 if a US‑backed draft peace plan is adopted, a timetable that would dramatically accelerate the bloc’s usual accession process.**  

The proposal, circulated among senior officials in Washington, Kyiv and Brussels, ties a cease‑fire and political settlement with Russia to a fast‑track EU entry for Ukraine. It enshrines a “fait accompli” clause that would make Ukraine’s accession a condition of any peace agreement, effectively obliging the European Council to open negotiations within months of the deal’s signing.

## Fast‑track mechanism  

Under the draft, Ukraine would move straight from candidate status—granted in June 2022—to full membership by the start of 2027. The plan would bypass several of the 36 accession chapters that normally require extensive reforms and unanimous approval from all 27 member states. Proponents argue that the extraordinary security context justifies an exceptional procedure.

## US backing and potential vetoes  

American officials have pledged political support, signalling they would pressure dissenting members such as Hungary’s Viktor Orban to drop any veto. Hungary has repeatedly blocked the opening of formal accession talks, citing concerns over rule‑of‑law standards. US involvement could therefore be decisive in overcoming that obstacle.

## Skepticism within the EU  

EU diplomats caution that the timeline “has little to do with reality”. Ukraine has yet to complete a single accession chapter, and the European Commission stresses that reforms must be verified before any formal negotiations can begin. Critics warn that a rushed accession could strain the bloc’s cohesion and set a precedent for future enlargements.

## What comes next  

The draft remains confidential and is not yet on the formal agenda of the European Council. Sources say it will be discussed at the upcoming EU‑US summit in Brussels later this month. If accepted, the plan would mark the most rapid EU enlargement in the bloc’s history and could reshape the diplomatic calculus of the Russia‑Ukraine war.
