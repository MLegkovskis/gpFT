# Trump's 15-Day Ultimatum to Iran
The Trump administration has given Iran a 15-day deadline to agree to a deal that includes the complete dismantling of its nuclear enrichment program, a cap on long-range ballistic-missile stockpiles, and an end to support for militant groups. Failure to comply with these demands will result in 'bad things' happening, according to Trump.
## Key Conditions of the Deal
The US is insisting on four key conditions for a deal with Iran:
* Complete abandonment of Iran's nuclear enrichment program
* Removal of all enriched uranium from Iran
* Cap on long-range ballistic-missile stockpiles
* End of support for regional militant proxies
## Potential Geopolitical Implications
The US-Iran standoff has significant geopolitical implications, including the potential for a broader conflict in the Middle East. Regional countries are bracing for impact, with some deepening security ties with the US and Israel, while others are warning of the dangers of escalation.
## Economic Impact
The situation is also having an economic impact, with oil prices rising in response to the increased tensions. A US strike on Iran could disrupt the Strait of Hormuz, which carries around 20% of global oil shipments, leading to a spike in oil prices.
