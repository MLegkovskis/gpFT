**Delivery Hero backs CEO Niklas Östberg while openly scouting a sale, a move forced by mounting shareholder pressure and a dwindling cash pile – the share price slipped 0.5 % to €21.44 on the news, leaving it 41 % below its 52‑week high of €36.45.**  

The German‑based food‑delivery group announced on 12 December 2025 that its board continues to stand behind Östberg even as it evaluates strategic options, including partial or full divestments. The statement came after Prosus, the largest shareholder with a 27 % stake, signalled a mandatory divestiture by August 2026 to satisfy EU antitrust clearance for the Just Eat‑Takeaway.com merger, and after activist investors such as Aspex Management pressed for a strategic review. The market’s immediate reaction was modest – shares fell from €21.50 to €21.44, a 0.5 % dip – but the price remains entrenched at roughly €21.40, a 41.2 % discount to the €36.45 peak reached in October 2024【CNBC】.  

The episode fits a familiar pattern that has characterised Delivery Hero’s post‑IPO journey. After a flamboyant debut on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in June 2017, the company raised €450‑€465 million at a valuation just above €5 bn, with founder‑CEO Östberg boasting “overwhelming” investor demand【Reuters】【TechCrunch】. Within a year the market cap surged to €8.2 bn, an 82 % jump, before a steep decline set in as rivals such as Uber, Just Eat, Deliveroo and Meituan intensified competition. By early 2022 the share price had sunk below the €24.96 IPO level, a 75 % fall from its 2021 peak【Bloomberg】.  

From 2023 onward, activist pressure sharpened. Aspex Management, holding more than 5 % of the stock, publicly urged a strategic review that could include asset sales【Yahoo Finance】. Prosus, which owned 27.4 % in 2023, later announced a legally‑mandated divestiture to clear the Just Eat‑Takeaway.com merger, adding a hard deadline to the board’s deliberations【Yahoo Finance】. Meanwhile, the balance sheet tightened: cash fell to €2.2 bn after €0.9 bn of convertible buy‑backs and €0.5 bn of extraordinary outflows, leaving net debt around €1.5 bn in Q3 2025【Tech in Asia】.  

Each crisis has been met with a familiar defensive play – the board leans on Östberg’s credibility while signalling a strategic review. In 2022 the company used convertible buy‑backs to prop up the share price, only to provoke further scrutiny. In 2025 the board again combined a public CEO endorsement with an explicit exploration of sale options, hoping to calm activist shareholders while keeping the door open to a potential transaction. Barclays analysts note that the Prosus deadline and the upcoming AGM make “movement of some sort” likely in the next few months【Yahoo Finance】.  

Analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Despite the 0.5 % dip, the stock has risen 6.57 % over the prior two weeks, and a “Buy” consensus with a 12‑month target of €29.49 suggests a 38 % upside from current levels【MSN】. The fundamental issue, however, is the widening gap between the current €21.44 price and the €36.45 52‑week high – a 41 % discount that underscores the market’s lingering scepticism.  

**Bottom line:** The December 2025 announcement is less a surprise than the latest chapter in a six‑year saga of shareholder activism, capital‑structure strain and strategic‑review signalling. With Prosus’s forced exit looming and the share price still far below its historic peak, Delivery Hero’s board is compelled to keep the sale option on the table, while relying on Östberg’s leadership to navigate the next phase of uncertainty.
