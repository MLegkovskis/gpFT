# Delivery Hero backs CEO while exploring sale under investor pressure 

**Delivery Hero’s board has publicly reaffirmed confidence in chief executive Niklas Östberg even as large shareholders press for a strategic review that could culminate in a sale or divestment. The announcement on 13 December 2025 sent the stock down about 1 % to €21.44, leaving the shares roughly a third of the way below their 52‑week peak of €32.57.** 

The market reaction mirrors a familiar pattern in the food‑delivery arena: a steep share‑price decline triggers activist scrutiny, yet boards often choose continuity of leadership while commissioning a review. In Delivery Hero’s case, activist pressure emerged in November 2024 when Aspex Management, holding around 5 % of the company, joined other institutional investors in demanding a strategic overhaul. The share price has slumped about 50 % year‑on‑year, echoing the 45 % fall that preceded DoorDash’s activist push in early 2022. 

Historically, investors with stakes of 3‑6 % are the most vocal. At Grubhub, Elliott Management’s 5 % holding prompted a call for a spin‑off of its restaurant‑technology unit, yet the CEO retained board backing. Similarly, Cevian Capital and APG, each with roughly 4 % of Just Eat Takeaway.com, pressed for the sale of non‑core assets after a $7.3 bn Grubhub acquisition, ultimately leading to a leadership change. By contrast, DoorDash and Uber Eats weathered activist demands by keeping their founders—Tony Xu and Dara Khosrowshahi—at the helm while undertaking strategic reviews. 

Delivery Hero now sits on the “retention‑with‑review” track. The board’s statement that Östberg’s long‑term vision remains the cornerstone of growth mirrors the language used by DoorDash’s board when it defended its founder‑CEO. If the forthcoming review uncovers fundamental mis‑alignment, the company could follow the Just Eat Takeaway.com or Starbucks playbooks, where boards replaced CEOs to signal a new direction. However, the prevailing data suggest a high probability of continuity: a Food Institute analysis in September 2025 found that 68 % of CEOs retained board endorsement survive at least twelve months after such pressure. 

The financial stakes are stark. Delivery Hero’s share price is down roughly 34 % from its 52‑week high, while the broader sector has seen valuations swing dramatically. Uber’s $2.65 bn Postmates acquisition lifted Uber Eats’ contribution to overall revenue from 12 % in 2020 to 18 % in 2023, yet investors remain wary of large‑scale deals without clear profitability pathways. DoorDash’s market capitalisation halved from its post‑IPO peak of US$60 bn in February 2021 to US$30 bn by October 2022, underscoring the volatility that can accompany aggressive growth strategies. 

For Delivery Hero, the immediate market response— a modest 1 % dip—suggests investors are weighing the reassurance of CEO backing against the uncertainty of a possible sale. The company’s next steps, particularly the timing and scope of the strategic review slated for the second quarter of 2025, will be closely watched. Should the board decide on divestments, the precedent set by Grubhub’s spin‑off and Just Eat Takeaway’s asset sales indicates that such moves can be executed without displacing the chief executive, provided the overarching vision remains intact. 

In the short term, the stock’s distance from its 52‑week high reflects both the lingering impact of the prior year’s price erosion and the market’s cautious optimism that Östberg’s leadership can navigate the crossroads. As activist investors continue to sharpen their focus on profitability and strategic clarity, Delivery Hero’s ability to balance continuity with decisive action will determine whether it joins the ranks of companies that emerge stronger after a review, or becomes another case where board‑driven change reshapes the leadership landscape.
