The 1,000 tonnes of uranium in Niger is a significant concern for global security, particularly given the threat posed by ISIS. However, the current security measures in place to protect the uranium are robust and multi-layered. The uranium is stored in a secure facility at Air Base 101, with features such as a reinforced fence, armed guard posts, and biometric access control. The IAEA and other international organizations are providing support to local authorities to secure and monitor the uranium, including training and equipment. While recent incidents have tested the security regime, the core measures have remained effective, and the risk of the uranium falling into the wrong hands appears to be low.
