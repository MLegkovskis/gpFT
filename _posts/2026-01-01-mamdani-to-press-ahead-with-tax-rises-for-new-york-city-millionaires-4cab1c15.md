**Zohran Mamdadi is set to advance a 2‑percentage‑point increase in New York City’s marginal income‑tax rate for earners above $1 million, a move projected to generate $9‑$10 billion annually – roughly one‑tenth of the city’s FY 2025 budget – and to add a modest boost to the metropolis’s real GDP growth.** 

The administration’s own calculations, echoed by the *Financial Times* and the Empire Center, place the revenue from the millionaire‑tax proposal at $9 billion to $10 billion a year. With the FY 2025 adopted budget standing at $106.5 billion – $71.5 billion in operating costs and $35.5 billion in capital spending – the infusion would cover between 8.5 % and 9.4 % of total outlays. Reuters, citing the same figures on 31 December 2025, summed the contribution as “roughly 9 % of the FY 2025 budget.” 

Beyond balancing the books, the tax is earmarked for a suite of public‑investment programmes, including infrastructure upgrades, universal childcare and other services that the mayor’s office argues will sharpen the city’s competitive edge. The Independent Budget Office (IBO) forecasts real GDP growth of 1.7 % for 2025 and 2.3 % for 2026. In its December 2023 report the IBO noted that “additional revenue streams such as the proposed millionaire tax are expected to support modest upward revisions to the 2026‑2027 GDP growth forecasts, potentially adding 0.1‑0.2 percentage points.” Empire State Development economists, quoted by Reuters, put the lift at 0.15 percentage points in 2026, assuming the new funds are deployed as intended. 

The fiscal rationale rests on a simple arithmetic: a targeted levy on the city’s wealthiest residents can close a shortfall without widening the tax base for the broader populace. By directing the proceeds toward capital projects, the administration hopes to generate a multiplier effect, spurring construction activity, creating jobs and, ultimately, expanding the tax base further. The projected 0.15 percentage‑point boost to real GDP growth, while modest, could translate into several hundred million dollars of additional economic activity, according to the Empire State Development analysis. 

Critics, however, warn that the tax could erode New York’s allure for high‑net‑worth individuals, potentially prompting capital flight or discouraging new investment. While the research notes do not provide direct quotations from stakeholders such as the mayor, the City Council or billionaire business leaders, the debate mirrors earlier discussions in other jurisdictions where similar levies have been contemplated. Proponents argue that the revenue will fund public goods that benefit all residents, including the affluent, while opponents contend that any increase in tax liability may tip the scales in favour of competing metros. 

The policy’s success will hinge on the city’s ability to translate the windfall into tangible improvements that outweigh perceived fiscal burdens. If the infrastructure and social programmes financed by the tax deliver measurable enhancements in quality of life and economic productivity, the modest GDP uplift could be the first of many positive feedback loops. Conversely, if the funds are misallocated or the tax proves a deterrent to wealth creation, the anticipated fiscal and growth benefits may remain theoretical. 

As New York City prepares to implement the millionaire‑tax, the coming months will test whether the projected 8½ %–9½ % budget contribution and the 0.1‑0.2 percentage‑point GDP lift materialise in practice, and whether the city can balance fiscal ambition with the need to retain its status as a global magnet for talent and capital.
