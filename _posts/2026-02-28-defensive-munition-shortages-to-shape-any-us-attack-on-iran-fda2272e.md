### Defensive Munition Shortages and US Attack on Iran
The US is taking proactive steps to address the shortage of defensive munitions, which could shape any potential attack on Iran. Through diplomatic and procurement efforts, the US is working to enhance its military capabilities and readiness. 
#### Key Actions
* The US has established a Targeting Working Group to ensure that all new Foreign Military Sales of US-origin munitions include an Air-to-Target-Destruction (ATD) capability
* The US will earmark up to $150 million in additional security-assistance funds to help allies retrofit ATD kits on existing stocks
* The Munitions Modernization Program (MMP) aims to add 1.2 million precision-guided munitions to the US stockpile by 2030
* Co-production agreements with Japan and Australia will shorten lead times for missile and rocket systems
* A strategic defense partnership with India will explore joint production of 155-mm artillery shells
#### International Collaborations
The US is exploring international collaborations with various countries, including Japan, Australia, India, and NATO allies. These partnerships aim to create a shared pool of precision-guided munitions, enhance supply chains, and reduce lead times. 
#### Implications for a Potential US Attack on Iran
These efforts will shape a potential US attack on Iran by ensuring that regional partners can employ US-supplied precision munitions without delay, expanding the 'shoot-and-move' envelope against Iranian air defenses. The MMP's surge in precision-guided munitions will raise the number of ready-to-fire strike packages, and co-production agreements will shorten lead times.
