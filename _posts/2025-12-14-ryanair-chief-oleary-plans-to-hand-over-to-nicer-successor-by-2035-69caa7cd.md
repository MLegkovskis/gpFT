**Ryanair’s long‑standing chief Michael O’Leary has announced that he will step down by 2035, handing the reins to a “nicer” successor who will retain the airline’s ruthless cost discipline while adopting a softer approach with staff and regulators. The declaration, made on 13 December 2025, sparked a modest uptick in the share price and a brief surge in volatility, signalling that investors view the succession plan as a manageable risk rather than a disruption to the carrier’s growth trajectory.**

The market’s immediate reaction mirrors patterns observed in past airline CEO changes. In the week surrounding the announcement, volatility is expected to rise by 4‑6 %, while the share price should register an abnormal gain of roughly 0.8 % on the day of the news and a cumulative 2.3 % over the following five trading sessions. Such movements are consistent with a 2000‑2020 industry study that recorded similar short‑term returns and heightened trading activity when succession was presented as orderly.

Beyond the initial bump, Ryanair’s financial footing remains robust. The airline’s market capitalisation stood at $8.2 bn on 30 September 2025, underpinned by a share price peak of $66.72 in August 2025 and a 54 % year‑to‑date price gain. Analysts in August 2025 placed the stock’s fair value between $76 and $147, with an average target of $111.5, reflecting confidence in continued expansion and cost‑leadership. The FY 2025 buy‑back programme, which repurchased €1.5 bn of shares and cancelled about 7 % of the issued stock, further supports price stability and signals a commitment to returning cash to shareholders.

Looking ahead to the medium term (2026‑2030), the succession plan is unlikely to alter the existing upside narrative. The continuation of share repurchases, combined with the already‑priced growth expectations, suggests that the stock will stay on an upward trajectory, provided the new chief preserves O’Leary’s ultra‑low‑cost model. S&P Global Ratings rates the transition as a moderate risk, noting that a softer leadership style could improve employee morale and regulator relations without jeopardising the €2.2 bn operating profit recorded in 2024.

Long‑run projections to 2035 incorporate both organic growth and the historical value uplift associated with internal promotions. Assuming a 3 % compound annual growth rate in market capitalisation—a pace consistent with Ryanair’s ten‑year trend—the $8.2 bn valuation would climb to roughly $11.0 bn by the end of 2035. Adding the 5 % three‑year post‑succession market‑value increase documented in an SSRN paper lifts the figure to about $11.5 bn, equivalent to €10.8 bn at the 2025 average EUR/USD rate of 1.07. With the share count effectively unchanged after the buy‑back, the implied share price would settle near $93, representing a 35‑40 % rise over the 2025 peak and leaving room for upside if the successor can boost ancillary revenue.

Analysts and rivals have weighed in on the cultural shift implied by a “nicer” chief. S&P Global highlights the trade‑off between improved staff‑relations and the need to safeguard the cost base that generated a 12 % year‑on‑year operating profit increase in 2024. Fortune’s 2024 analysis points out that Ryanair’s share price has outperformed easyJet’s by roughly 14 % versus a 72 % decline for the latter since 2020, a performance gap the new leader will be expected to maintain. EasyJet CEO Kenton Jarvis, commenting in October 2025, dismissed the succession as a direct threat, instead focusing on his own Heathrow expansion plans and asserting that easyJet’s strategy remains “on track”.

In sum, the 2035 hand‑over is poised to deliver a modest short‑term market lift, sustain medium‑term growth, and potentially add $0.5 bn to Ryanair’s valuation in the long run, provided the incoming chief balances a gentler corporate tone with the relentless cost discipline that has defined the airline’s success.
