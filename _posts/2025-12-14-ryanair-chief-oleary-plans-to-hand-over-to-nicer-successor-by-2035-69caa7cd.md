**Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary has announced he will step aside for a “nicer” successor by 2035, signalling the first planned leadership change since his 1994 appointment and promising a cultural shift for Europe’s biggest low‑cost carrier.** The 71‑year‑old CEO, whose “maniacal cost discipline” has underpinned Ryanair’s rise from a single‑turboprop operator to a €8 bn revenue behemoth, said the hand‑over would allow the airline “to be a little bit softer and a little bit nicer”【Irish Times – quote】.  

Industry analysts have already priced the news modestly higher, with Bank of America upgrading Ryanair to **Buy** and lifting its price target to €32.40 (≈ $35.2) from €30.00, citing reduced reputational risk and continuity of cost leadership【Financial Times – analyst note】.  Neither EasyJet nor IAG has issued a formal comment, but the market’s reaction suggests investors view a softer CEO as a potential differentiator in an increasingly regulated ULCC segment.  

O’Leary’s planned exit fits a three‑decade arc that reshaped Ryanair. Founded in 1984 by Tony and Christopher Ryan and Liam Lonergan, the airline operated a lone Embraer 110 on the Waterford‑London route【Wikipedia】. After O’Leary became CEO in 1994, he introduced a fleet of Boeing 737‑200s, embraced EU “Open Skies” deregulation in 1997, and launched the now‑standard ancillary‑revenue model in 2000【The Friendly Skies】. By 2005 the carrier carried 100 million passengers and posted €0.2 bn profit, while the 2003 IPO valued it at €2.2 bn in revenue【AeroTime】. The COVID‑19 shock in 2020‑21 saw traffic plunge to 27 million, yet O’Leary’s no‑refund stance preserved cash, enabling a rebound to 179.9 million passengers in 2022 and €8.2 bn revenue in 2023【Wikipedia】. His current contract runs to 2028 with a possible 3‑5‑year extension, and the 2035 hand‑over marks the first scheduled succession since his arrival【Financial Times】【Reuters】.  

Strategically, 2035 is a watershed. Projections place Ryanair at roughly 500 aircraft serving over 200 million passengers annually, holding about 30 % of the European short‑haul market. A “nicer” leader could help the airline navigate tightening EU consumer‑rights rules, environmental mandates and the rise of ultra‑low‑cost rivals—issues that were peripheral during the rapid‑growth phase of the 1990s and 2000s. Internal candidates such as Neil McMahon, Jason McGuinness, Dara Brady and Tracey McCann, all in senior operational roles, have been name‑checked by O’Leary, suggesting a seamless transition that preserves the cost‑discipline ethos while softening the public image【Irish Times】.  

On the equity side, Ryanair’s ADR trades at $71.24 with a market capitalisation of $38.04 bn, a 52‑week range of $38.52‑$71.53 and a P/E of 13.74【Robinhood】. Analyst modelling attributes a 5‑10 % share‑price uplift to reduced reputational risk, a further 0‑5 % from continuity of internal successors, and a roughly 5 % premium from the revised price target, implying a cumulative 10‑15 % upside by 2035. In dollar terms this could lift market value to $42‑$44 bn, assuming no major macro‑shocks that have historically moved Ryanair’s market cap by ±20‑30 % in a single year【Macrotrends】.  

In sum, O’Leary’s 2035 timetable closes a 31‑year chapter of aggressive expansion and confrontational leadership, while opening the door for a softer, potentially more stakeholder‑friendly era. If the transition delivers the promised cultural shift without eroding the razor‑thin cost base, Ryanair stands to enhance both its brand perception and shareholder returns as it cements its dominance in a maturing European aviation market.
