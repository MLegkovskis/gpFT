**Zelenskyy’s push to turn €185 billion of frozen Russian cash into a €90 billion loan for Kyiv has sparked a rare stand‑off with Belgium’s finance chief, threatening to test the cohesion of the EU’s sanctions regime at a time when the continent is scrambling for resources to sustain Ukraine’s war effort.** 

The crux of the dispute lies in the €185 billion held by Euroclear, the Belgian clearing house that sits at the heart of the EU’s frozen‑asset pool. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, argued in Brussels on 14 December 2025 that “it’s only fair that Russia’s frozen assets should be used to rebuild what Russia has destroyed – and that money then becomes ours.” The proposal would channel two‑thirds of Ukraine’s estimated €135.7 billion financing need for the next two years into a single “reparations loan” of €90 billion, effectively converting the frozen sovereign holdings into a direct cash infusion for Kyiv’s defence and reconstruction.

Belgium, however, faces a disproportionate fiscal exposure. Professor Veerle Colaert of KU Leuven warned that “Belgium is a small economy. Belgian GDP is about €565 billion – imagine if it would need to shoulder a €185 billion bill.” The concern is not merely political; it is also financial. The EU’s broader freeze, initiated on 24 February 2022, now encompasses up to €210 billion of Russian sovereign assets across the bloc, with Euroclear’s share representing the lion’s share.

From a macro‑economic perspective, the seizure of the €185 billion would amount to roughly 2 % of Russia’s gross domestic product. An OSW Institute commentary dated 1 September 2025 calculated that assets seized by foreign authorities between February 2022 and June 2025 totalled about 3.9 trillion roubles – approximately US$50 billion – equating to 2 % of Russia’s GDP. The Bank of Russia’s own analysis of sanctions‑induced drag places the overall impact at 0.5 % of GDP in the first year and 0.6 % in the second, suggesting that a one‑off loss of €185 billion (around US$200 billion) could deepen the contraction into the 1‑2 % range, depending on how swiftly and securely the assets are transferred.

The financial stakes are already evident. Between 2024 and 2025, Euroclear paid €3.7 billion in “wind‑fall profits” to Ukraine, a modest fraction of the total pool but a tangible illustration of how frozen assets can be monetised. Yet the prospect of converting the entire €185 billion into a loan raises legal and procedural questions that Belgium is reluctant to resolve without clear EU consensus. The stand‑off therefore pits Kyiv’s urgent funding needs against Brussels’ caution over precedent‑setting asset seizures that could reverberate across European financial markets.

If the impasse persists, the EU risks undermining the credibility of its sanctions architecture at a moment when unity is essential. A failure to unlock the assets could force Ukraine to seek alternative financing, potentially at higher cost, while also emboldening Russian narratives that Western measures are inconsistent. Conversely, a decisive move to release the funds would signal a robust, coordinated response, reinforcing the message that the EU can translate punitive measures into tangible support for its allies.

The coming weeks will test whether Belgium, as the custodian of Euroclear, can bridge the gap between legal prudence and geopolitical urgency. The outcome will not only shape the scale of Ukraine’s war chest but also define the limits of European solidarity in the face of an entrenched conflict.
