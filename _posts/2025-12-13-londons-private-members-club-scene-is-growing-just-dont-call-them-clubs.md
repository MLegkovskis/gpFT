**London's private members' club scene is experiencing unprecedented growth, with over 130 clubs now operating in the city and 8-9 more slated to open in the next 12 months**. This surge in growth has led to a significant increase in membership, with Soho House properties alone seeing a 57% jump in membership from 2021 to 2023, reaching over 176,000 members. The sector is projected to be worth £25.8 billion by 2027, with an annual growth rate of approximately 11%. As Jamie Caring, a private-club consultant, notes, "The world of clubs is definitely expanding... London is the club capital of the world. And there's still a lot of room for growth."

The growth of the private members' club scene is not without its challenges, however. Insiders warn of oversaturation, with Seth Alexander Thévoz, author of *London Clubland*, stating, "There are probably 133 private members' clubs active in London... I have heard of 'eight or nine' more imminent openings." Additionally, high fit-out costs and intensive staffing mean clubs are vulnerable if membership churn rises. Despite these risks, the sector remains lucrative, with membership fees generating £1,500-4,000 per year per member, and flagship clubs like Soho House pulling in approximately US$289 million in quarterly revenue.

The private members' club scene is also having a significant impact on the city's social and economic landscape. As Claire Ilardi-Crow, a membership adviser, notes, "Everyone's trying to get into it... brands, hotels, restaurants all look at the club model and ask 'how hard can it be?'" The surge in club openings is reshaping heritage precincts and driving luxury-retail spill-over, with high-end boutiques and art galleries opening in areas surrounding the clubs. Mayor Sadiq Khan's pedestrian-friendly Oxford Street plan and relaxed licensing rules are also expected to create "experience-led retail zones" that will benefit private-members' clubs.

The Mayor's efforts to promote the private members' club scene are seen as a recognition of their social and economic contribution to London's nightlife and high-value retail ecosystem. As a source close to the Mayor notes, "Over recent years London's pubs, restaurants, clubs and music venues have been seen as a problem to be managed, rather than a vital part of the city's economic and social life." With the sector projected to continue growing, it will be interesting to see how the private members' club scene evolves and how it will shape the city's social and economic landscape.
