**London’s private members’ clubs are proliferating, with at least 27 venues now operating in the capital and membership fees rising 12 % year‑on‑year to an average of £1,200 a annum, as affluent professionals seek curated social spaces that feel more like curated co‑working hubs than traditional gentlemen’s clubs.**  

## A New Definition of “Club”  
The term “club” is being deliberately avoided by many operators. Spaces such as The Ned, The Club at The Shard and the newly launched 42 Westminster market themselves as “members’ venues” or “social lounges”, emphasising flexibility, wellness and cultural programming over the historic rituals of dining and card games. This re‑branding aims to attract a younger, more diverse clientele—particularly freelancers, tech entrepreneurs and creative professionals—who value community without the formality of legacy institutions.

## Membership Growth and Waitlists  
Data compiled by market analyst Euromonitor shows that the number of private members’ venues in Greater London grew from 19 in 2019 to 27 in 2024, a 42 % increase. Membership applications rose 18 % in 2023, with several clubs reporting waitlists of 12‑24 months. The Arts Club, for example, capped its new intake at 500 members in 2023, citing “capacity constraints” despite a 30 % surge in enquiries. Average annual fees now range from £800 for boutique wellness‑focused spaces to £3,500 for ultra‑luxury locations such as The Goring Club.

## Diversified Offerings  
Modern venues blend hospitality with lifestyle services:

* **Wellness** – The 5‑Star Club on Marylebone Road offers daily yoga, a meditation suite and a 24‑hour spa, accounting for 35 % of its members’ usage time.  
* **Culture** – The Royal Academy’s private lounge hosts monthly artist talks and exclusive exhibition previews, attracting 40 % of its 1,200 members.  
* **Business** – The Club at The Shard provides private meeting rooms and a concierge service, reporting that 28 % of members use the space for client entertainment.  

These mixed‑use models have driven higher ancillary spend; Euromonitor estimates average per‑member ancillary revenue at £450 per year, up from £320 in 2020.

## Financial Performance  
While clubs do not publish audited accounts, industry insiders estimate the sector generated roughly £250 million in revenue in 2023, a 9 % increase on the previous year. Venture‑backed operators such as Soho House have secured £150 million in fresh capital, citing “robust demand for premium, member‑only experiences”. The rise in fees and ancillary spend has improved profit margins, with some venues reporting EBITDA of 22 % versus the sector average of 15 % in 2022.

## Outlook  
Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence project the number of London members’ venues to exceed 30 by 2026, driven by continued remote‑working trends and a desire for “third‑places” that blend social, professional and wellness functions. However, regulatory scrutiny over anti‑money‑laundering checks could tighten entry criteria, potentially curbing the rapid expansion.

The evolution from traditional gentlemen’s clubs to multifaceted members’ venues reflects broader shifts in how London’s affluent and aspirational professionals network, relax and conduct business—underscoring a sector that is growing, diversifying and, increasingly, shedding its historic label.
