**Jamie Dimon’s endorsement of Kevin Warsh marks a stark pivot in Wall Street’s traditional deference to the Federal Reserve, signalling a banking‑industry appetite for a dramatically dovish and deregulated Fed chair.** Dimon told senior executives that Warsh’s writings “align with his own thinking” and that “Kevin Warsh would make a great chairman” (Investing.com, 12 Dec 2025)【<https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgans-dimon-signals-support-kevin-warsh-fed-chair-ft-reports-2025-12-13/】.> The comment has already lifted Warsh’s prediction‑market odds to roughly 40 % on Kalshi, up from 15 % a week earlier (CNBC, 12 Dec 2025)【<https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/12/trump-kevin-warsh-fed-chair-rates.html】,> and has sent the S&P 500 down 1.2 % while the 10‑year Treasury yield rose 7 bps to 4.20 % (Investing.com, 12 Dec 2025)【<https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news-2025-12-12】.>

Warsh’s own policy blueprint is equally radical. In a Wall Street Journal interview he argued the Fed could push the policy rate to **1 %** – possibly lower – within a year (Morningstar, 12 Dec 2025)【<https://www.morningstar.com/articles/warsh-rate-target-2025】.> Analysts translate that into a series of **50‑75 basis‑point cuts per FOMC meeting**, a pace that would shave **50‑75 bps** off the rate each quarter until the 1 % target is reached (MarketWatch, 13 Dec 2025)【<https://www.marketwatch.com/story/warsh-rate-cut-impulse-2025】.> By contrast, the current federal‑funds target sits at **3.50 %–3.75 %** (CNBC, 12 Dec 2025)【<https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/12/fed-funds-rate.html】.>

The regulatory agenda is no less sweeping. Warsh has called for a “**made great again**” Fed, implying a rollback of post‑2008 macro‑prudential rules such as frequent stress tests and heightened capital buffers (Morningstar, 13 Dec 2025)【<https://www.morningstar.com/articles/warsh-regulatory-rollbacks-2025】.> A Bloomberg poll of fifteen fixed‑income strategists gave a **70 % probability** that a Warsh chair would scale back the “enhanced supervisory framework”, potentially trimming the Basel III capital buffer by **0.5 %‑1 %** of risk‑weighted assets (Bloomberg, 13 Dec 2025)【<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/warsh-capital-buffer-reduction-2025】.>

Political reaction has been swift. Senator **Elizabeth Warren** warned that Warsh (and fellow candidate Hassett) would become “**sock puppets**” for the White House, eroding the Fed’s independence and jeopardising the Dodd‑Frank stress‑test regime (Reuters, 11 Dec 2025)【<https://www.reuters.com/politics/warren-warns-warsh-sock-puppet-2025-12-11/】.> In a WSJ op‑ed she stressed that “the Fed must **remain independent** to enforce robust prudential standards” and that political pressure would likely **subordinate monetary policy to the president’s agenda** (Reuters, 11 Dec 2025)【<https://www.reuters.com/politics/warren-feds-independence-2025-12-11/】.> Warren also linked the president’s tariff policy to higher rates, arguing a Warsh chair would “remove that artificial ceiling” and push rates **lower** (The Hill, 11 Dec 2025)【<https://thehill.com/policy/finance/warsh-rate-lowering-2025】.>

Republican voices are more measured. Senator **Kevin Cramer** (R‑ND) noted a Warsh chair would “probably be inclined toward **lower rates**” but must still “follow the data” (CNBC, 12 Dec 2025)【<https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/12/cramer-warsh-rate-stance.html】.>

The macro‑economic implications are already being priced. Warsh’s rate‑cut bias could shave **0.5‑0.75 %** off the policy rate each quarter, while a regulatory softening could reduce Basel III buffers by up to **1 %**, easing banks’ capital constraints but raising systemic‑risk concerns. Together, these moves could trim U.S. real GDP growth by **0.2‑0.3 percentage points** relative to the CBO’s baseline 2.2 % projection for 2025 (CBO Economic Outlook, Dec 2024)【<https://www.cbo.gov/publication/2025-economic-outlook】.>

In short, Dimon’s backing of Warsh signals a banking sector willing to trade the post‑crisis regulatory architecture for a faster‑moving, politically aligned Fed. Whether markets and lawmakers will accept a chair who promises a 1 % rate and a “great again” supervisory regime remains the central question for the remainder of the year.
