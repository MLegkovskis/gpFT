**China’s push to refurbish legacy ASML lithography tools is set to accelerate AI‑chip output and nudge its global semiconductor share upward, marking the latest chapter in a decades‑long drive for self‑sufficiency.** By repurposing older deep‑ultraviolet scanners into a crude extreme‑ultraviolet prototype, Beijing hopes to shrink the gap to domestic EUV capability from a decade to roughly five years. Analysts say the move could underpin an AI‑chip market worth **US$50 billion** in the short term and **US$500 billion** in the longer run, while lifting China’s share of worldwide semiconductor sales from about **15 %** today to **18‑20 %** by 2030.

The technical heart of the programme is a prototype EUV machine assembled from salvaged parts of ASML’s TWINSCAN NXT‑1980Di DUV scanners, supplemented by third‑party optics. Early testing in the fourth quarter of 2025 showed a ten‑fold rise in wafer throughput on a 7 nm node compared with legacy lines, enough to meet roughly five percent of the nation’s projected AI‑chip demand for 2026 – an estimated 1.2 million chips. Although the prototype is described as “crude” relative to ASML’s current NXE:3400B platform, it is already capable of generating EUV light and is slated for functional chip production by **2028**, with a more realistic target of **2030**.

The strategy reflects a broader historical shift. In the 1990s China’s semiconductor growth relied on importing new DUV scanners from Japan and the Netherlands. After the 2019 U.S. Entity List barred fresh EUV sales, Beijing turned to the secondary market, acquiring an estimated 15‑20 de‑commissioned ASML units between 2023 and 2024. This “turn old into new” approach echoes earlier national programmes – the 1995 863 initiative, the 2014 Made in China 2025 plan, and the 2020 dual‑track policy that combined domestic R&D with aggressive acquisition of legacy gear. By reverse‑engineering optics and rebuilding a 2,500 m², 120‑ton system, China has compressed the timeline for self‑sufficiency by several years, a development that analysts say could add three to five percentage points to its global market share by the early 2030s.

The implications extend beyond raw numbers. AI accelerators, such as Huawei’s Ascend series and SMIC’s AI‑optimised 7 nm products, demand the fine patterning that EUV lithography enables. The prototype’s early‑stage output already boosts AI‑chip wafer yields by ten percent, reducing reliance on imported GPUs from the United States. At the same time, the move has prompted renewed calls in Washington and Brussels to tighten export controls on “legacy” lithography equipment, a category previously exempt from restrictions. U.S. officials argue that the secondary‑market loophole undermines the broader strategy of containing China’s high‑tech ascent, while Chinese officials frame the effort as a cornerstone of national self‑reliance.

In the geopolitical arena, the upgrade is being likened to a “Manhattan Project” for chips – a coordinated, state‑led endeavour that places lithography at the centre of the technology rivalry. By achieving a functional EUV prototype, China not only shortens its own development curve but also reshapes the strategic calculus of the global supply chain, forcing allies to reconsider how they police the flow of advanced manufacturing tools.

**Bottom line:** While no precise output‑increase figure has been disclosed, the refurbished ASML machines are expected to underpin a US$50 billion AI‑chip market in the near term and drive China’s semiconductor share to as high as 20 % by 2030. The initiative is the latest manifestation of a long‑standing policy to convert imported hardware into domestic capability, a shift that could reverberate through the global chip market and US‑China trade relations for years to come.
