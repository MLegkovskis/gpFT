**Russia unleashed an unprecedented barrage of more than 650 Shahed‑type drones and over 30 sophisticated missiles on Ukraine’s power grid and civilian infrastructure during the night of 22‑23 December, just before the Christmas holidays, inflicting damage estimated at roughly US $410 million and prompting a projected 2 percent contraction in Ukraine’s first‑quarter 2026 GDP.** 

The overnight assault, confirmed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saw a mix of Shahed drones, Kh‑101 cruise missiles, Iskander‑K ballistic missiles and Kinzhal hypersonic weapons sweep across the country. Ukrainian officials described the strike as “literally all infrastructure of life,” noting that the sheer volume of munitions overwhelmed air defences and precipitated prolonged blackouts across industrial heartlands. 

Calculating the financial outlay of the attack relies on publicly reported price ranges for the weapons employed. Shahed drones, whose unit cost varies between US $10 000 and US $300 000, are conservatively valued at a midpoint of US $100 000 each, yielding a total of US $65 million for the 650‑strong fleet. The missile component, comprising roughly 30 Kh‑101, Iskander‑K and Kinzhal missiles, carries a midpoint price of US $11.5 million per round, amounting to US $345 million. Together, the munitions alone represent an estimated US $410 million expenditure by Moscow. 

Beyond the immediate material loss, the Ministry of Economy’s 27 December press release warned of a broader macro‑economic shock. The ministry projected that Ukraine’s gross domestic product for the first quarter of 2026 would shrink by about 2 percent year‑on‑year, a decline driven largely by the destruction of energy infrastructure. The loss of power generation capacity is expected to cut output in energy‑intensive sectors by roughly 1.2 percentage points, leaving the overall GDP contraction at 1.9 percent—approximately US $0.8 billion lower than earlier forecasts. In absolute terms, the damage translates into a loss of US $1.2‑1.3 billion of quarterly output, given a nominal Q1 2026 GDP of around US $65 billion. 

The economic ramifications extend beyond the immediate fiscal hit. Prolonged blackouts impede manufacturing, reduce agricultural processing, and strain logistics, all of which compound the fiscal strain already imposed by the war. Moreover, the attack underscores the strategic use of high‑cost, high‑impact weaponry to inflict not only physical destruction but also to erode economic resilience ahead of the winter season, when energy demand peaks. 

Analysts note that the attack’s timing—just before the holiday period—amplifies its disruptive potential, as both civilian morale and industrial output are vulnerable during this lull. The scale of the drone and missile deployment also signals a shift in Russian tactics, favouring saturation attacks that overwhelm defensive systems and maximise infrastructural damage. 

In the short term, Ukraine faces the daunting task of repairing its power network, restoring industrial capacity and securing additional financing to bridge the fiscal gap. International partners are likely to respond with renewed aid packages, but the immediate economic shock will be felt in reduced export volumes, higher energy costs and a tighter fiscal stance. The December onslaught thus represents a dual blow: a direct financial loss measured in hundreds of millions of dollars and a broader economic contraction that will reverberate through Ukraine’s economy well into 2026.
