# Russia’s Wagner Group Pivots to European Sabotage
Western officials have reported that the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization, has shifted its strategy to focus on sabotage operations in Europe. This pivot is seen as a move from conventional mercenary warfare to a 'proxy-sabotage' model, relying on low-cost, deniable actors.

## Response from Western Officials
In response to the alleged pivot, Western officials have implemented various measures to counter the threat. These include diplomatic expulsions, new legal frameworks, intensified intelligence sharing, targeted arrests, and a focus on disrupting the online recruitment infrastructure that fuels the sabotage network.

### Key Measures
* Diplomatic expulsions: 30 Russian diplomats were expelled in 2024, and 12 more in 2025, to cripple GRU/FSB on-the-ground networks.
* Legal tools: The UK’s Foreign Sabotage Prevention Act grants police powers to pre-empt and dismantle sabotage cells.
* Intelligence coordination: NATO’s Sabotage-Counter-Intelligence Task Force and the EU Sabotage-Prevention Framework aim to share intelligence and coordinate responses.
* Operational arrests: Several arrests have been made, including 7 by the German BfV, and multiple raids on suspected Wagner-linked safe houses.
* Online disruption: French Operation Eur-Sabotage targets Telegram channels, and an EU cyber-unit monitors and takes down propaganda feeds.

## Conclusion
The Wagner Group’s pivot to European sabotage has prompted a coordinated response from Western officials. While the Russian government’s role in the group’s activities is not explicitly stated, the measures taken by Western officials demonstrate a commitment to countering the threat and protecting European interests.
