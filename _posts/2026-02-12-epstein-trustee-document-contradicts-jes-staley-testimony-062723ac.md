# Epstein Trustee Document Contradicts Jes Staley Testimony
The recent discovery of a trustee document has contradicted Jes Staley's sworn testimony about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. This contradiction has significant implications for the banking sector, particularly for Barclays and JPMorgan, which may face further investigations, regulatory actions, and reputational damage.
## Market Reaction
The news has already led to a 2.1% decline in Barclays' share price and a 0.28% increase in JPMorgan's stock price. However, the potential long-term impact on the banks' stock prices and the overall trust in financial institutions remains uncertain.
## Regulatory Implications
The FCA has signalled that it will review its 'fit-and-proper' assessment regime for senior bankers, and the Upper Tribunal's decision may be appealed to the Court of Appeal. The U.S. Senate Finance Committee has issued a request for documents on communications between Staley, JPMorgan executives, and Epstein.
## Potential Consequences
The contradiction has the potential to trigger further investigations into financial malfeasance and systemic compliance failures within the banking sector. This could lead to additional fines, civil suits, and reputational damage for Barclays and JPMorgan.
