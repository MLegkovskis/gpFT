**Marco Rubio’s hard‑line stance on Venezuela has provoked a coordinated diplomatic rebuke across Latin America and sparked alarm in the region’s business community, raising the prospect of a sharp contraction in U.S. oil‑related trade and a broader chill to American investment.** 

Within 48 hours of Rubio’s announcement of an “oil quarantine” and his demand that Cuba, Russia, China and Iran withdraw advisers from Caracas, senior officials from Mexico, Argentina and Chile publicly denounced the move as a breach of the non‑intervention principle that underpins the OAS charter. Alicia Hernández, Mexico’s Secretary of Foreign Affairs, warned that the United States was “overstepping its regional role; this could destabilise the entire hemisphere.” Argentine Ambassador María López de Sá echoed the sentiment on Twitter, declaring the intervention a violation of international law and a threat to regional stability. Chilean Deputy Foreign Minister Luis Alvarez framed the action as a unilateral breach of the OAS charter, while interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodríguez, speaking on national television, vowed to defend sovereignty against what she termed “foreign aggression”.

The diplomatic outcry was matched by a swift response from the private sector. The Latin American Chamber of Commerce (LACC) warned that the unilateral U.S. action could expose investors to “potential loss of billions in cross‑border investments”. Carlos Gómez, president of the Latin American Business Council, quantified the risk in a Bloomberg interview, estimating a 3‑5 % decline in regional oil‑related trade volumes if the quarantine endures. PetroLatam’s chief executive, Eduardo Silva, projected a US $200 million reduction in the firm’s 2026 revenue forecast, citing contracts with Venezuelan refineries now on hold. The Mercosur Trade Association’s director, María Fernández, highlighted that the United States still imported US $1.1 billion of Venezuelan crude in 2023, a figure that could evaporate under Rubio’s policy, jeopardising the broader Mercosur‑U.S. trade agenda.

Trade data underscores the magnitude of the potential fallout. U.S. imports of Venezuelan crude have already fallen from US $5.5 billion in 2019 to US $1.1 billion in 2023, and total U.S. imports from Venezuela stand at US $2.1 billion. Regional oil‑related trade, encompassing Mercosur and Caribbean partners, amounts to roughly US $30 billion annually. A 3‑5 % contraction would translate into a loss of US $900 million‑$1.5 billion for the region. Moreover, U.S. foreign direct investment in Latin America, recorded at US $73 billion in 2024, could see a 5‑7 % reduction in projects linked to energy and infrastructure if retaliatory measures materialise.

The convergence of diplomatic condemnation and business‑sector anxiety suggests that Rubio’s gamble may backfire politically and economically. By attempting to force a rapid regime change in Caracas, the United States risks alienating key partners who view the move as a violation of hemispheric norms. The prospect of retaliatory non‑tariff barriers, coupled with the loss of remaining Venezuelan crude imports, could erode the modest recovery in U.S.–Latin America trade that has unfolded since the early 2020s.

If the oil quarantine persists, the United States may find its leverage in the region diminished, its investors exposed to heightened risk, and its strategic objectives in Venezuela thwarted by a coalition of governments and businesses determined to protect regional stability and economic interests.
