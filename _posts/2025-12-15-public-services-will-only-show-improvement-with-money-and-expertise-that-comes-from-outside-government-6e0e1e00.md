**Public services will only show improvement with money and expertise that comes from outside government**

The scale of investment required to lift public‑service provision to an “optimal” level is staggering: the United States would need roughly three percent of GDP – about US $0.8 trillion a year – while the United Kingdom would need four percent, or around £0.3 trillion. Across the OECD the gap is smaller, but still amounts to a hundred‑billion‑euro‑scale outlay. Yet the experience of the United Kingdom’s Private Finance Initiative (PFI) demonstrates that injecting private capital and expertise does not automatically translate into better or more efficient services. The lesson is that external resources must be coupled with robust governance and realistic cost assessments if they are to deliver the promised upgrades.

The “optimal” size of government, as identified by Economic Inquiry, sits at 23 percent of GDP, give or take two points. Current public‑service shares sit at about 20 percent in the United States (CBO, 2024) and 19 percent in the United Kingdom (ONS, 2023). Subtracting the two yields the additional spending required: three percent of US GDP and four percent of UK GDP. With the United States projected to have a GDP of US $26 trillion in 2025, the extra spend works out to roughly US $0.8 trillion. The United Kingdom’s GDP of £7.5 trillion translates to an extra £0.3 trillion. For the OECD average, a one‑percent gap in the EU‑27 economy of €12 trillion equates to about €0.12 trillion.

Fiscal multiplier evidence from the Richmond Federal Reserve (2025) suggests that each additional dollar of government spending lifts local GDP by between $1.30 and $2.00, with a midpoint of 1.65. Applying that multiplier, the US’s $0.8 trillion boost would raise total GDP by roughly $1.3 trillion – a 5 percent increase – comfortably covering the fiscal cost while delivering the desired service improvements. The same logic applies to the UK and OECD calculations, underscoring that the primary lever for better services is simply more fiscal capacity.

The PFI experience, however, warns that the source of funding matters as much as the amount. Launched in 1992 and expanded after the NHS (Private Finance) Act 1997, the scheme attracted about £600 billion of private contracts, with roughly £500 billion still in service as of 2021. Contracts typically run for 25‑30 years, locking public budgets into long‑term commitments. Private capital carries a cost premium of 7‑8 percent per annum versus the government’s 2‑3 percent, adding a five‑ to six‑percentage‑point surcharge. Over a 30‑year horizon this premium inflates a £100 billion portfolio by roughly £30 billion.

The financial burden translated into tangible service impacts. A University of Manchester study (2020) found that A&E waiting times in 30 PFI‑built hospitals were on average 4.3 hours, 12 percent longer than in comparable non‑PFI hospitals. Elective‑surgery waiting lists were 8 percent larger in PFI sites. Administrative overhead rose dramatically: NHS management costs climbed from about 5 percent of the budget in the mid‑1970s to over 14 percent by 2005, reflecting the resources required to manage complex contracts. Moreover, NHS trusts bound by 25‑year PFI deals have been paying £2‑3 billion annually in dividends, rent and debt service, siphoning funds away from frontline care.

The policy reversal in 2018 – the formal abolition of PFI and its successor PF2 – acknowledged these shortcomings. The experience shows that external money and expertise, when procured at a high cost of capital and without stringent performance safeguards, can erode fiscal sustainability and fail to improve service quality.

For governments seeking to upgrade health, education, social protection and infrastructure, the numbers are clear: a substantial increase in public‑service spending is required. Yet the path to that spending must avoid the pitfalls of past private‑finance experiments. Transparent contracts, competitive borrowing rates, and strong accountability mechanisms are essential if external resources are to complement, rather than compromise, the public good.
