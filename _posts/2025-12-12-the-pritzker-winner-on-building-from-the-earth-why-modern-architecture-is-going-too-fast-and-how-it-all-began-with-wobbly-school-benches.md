**Liu Jiakun, the 2025 Pritzker Architecture Prize laureate, says the future of building lies in “growing from the earth” – a return to local materials, slow‑thinking design and a critique of the break‑neck speed that now dominates global architecture.**  

## From wobbly school benches to global acclaim  
Jiakun’s fascination with architecture began in the 1970s when, as a student in Chengdu, he was asked to redesign a set of unstable school benches. The simple exercise sparked a lifelong preoccupation with how everyday objects can embody structural honesty and social purpose. He later founded Jiakun Architecture in 1999, a practice that has remained rooted in the Sichuan region while earning international recognition.

## “Building from the earth” – a material manifesto  
In his Pritzker acceptance lecture, Jiakun argued that architects should “listen to the soil” and employ locally sourced earth, timber and low‑tech concrete rather than rely on imported, high‑tech façades. Projects such as the Luyeyuan Stone Sculpture Art Museum (2002) and the West Village mixed‑use complex in Chengdu (2015) illustrate this ethos: poured‑concrete volumes sit within bamboo groves, courtyards echo traditional Chinese gardens, and the buildings are designed to age gracefully with their environment.

## Why modern architecture is moving too fast  
Jiakun warned that the industry’s obsession with rapid, image‑driven development erodes both social equity and ecological resilience. “When we chase the next iconic silhouette, we forget the people who will live, work and breathe in the spaces we create,” he told the jury in Abu Dhabi. He cites the post‑earthquake reconstruction in Wenchuan (2008) as a counter‑example, where community‑led, low‑tech interventions delivered lasting value far quicker than high‑budget, design‑centric schemes.

## A milestone for Asian architecture  
Jiakun becomes the first Chinese architect to win the Pritzker since Wang Shu (2012), underscoring a shift toward architects who prioritise context over signature style. His win is being celebrated with a virtual ceremony in May and a series of public lectures on sustainable, place‑based design.

The laureate’s message is clear: architecture must slow down, ground itself in local materiality, and serve the everyday lives of ordinary people – a lesson that begins, perhaps, with something as humble as a school bench.
