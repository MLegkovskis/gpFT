**José Antonio Kast’s decisive 57 % to 42 % victory in Chile’s presidential runoff on 15 December 2025 has been hailed by markets and foreign capitals as a clear swing back to a pro‑business, conservative agenda after years of protest‑driven constitutional turbulence.** The final tally from the Electoral Service (Servel) confirmed a 16‑point margin – larger than the minimum 10‑point lead forecast by the most cautious poll – and triggered a rally in Chilean equities, a modest appreciation of the peso and a dip in sovereign yields.

The result cemented the trajectory that began with the 2019‑2020 street protests, which forced a rewrite of Chile’s 1980 constitution and opened the political arena to new parties. While the reforms promised a more inclusive framework, the electorate’s turn to Kast, the Republican Party’s hard‑line candidate, signals a rejection of the left‑leaning momentum that had briefly surged after the constitutional referendum. The shift underscores a broader desire for stability and market‑friendly policies, a sentiment echoed in the rapid market response.

Kast’s lead was evident early in the count. Al Jazeera’s preliminary figures, covering 25 % of ballots, gave him 59.83 % against Jeannette Jara’s 40.17 % – a 19.66‑point advantage. As the count progressed to 83 % (DW), his share settled at 58 % to Jara’s 41 %, a 17‑point gap. The official Servel result of 57.9 % to 41.9 % confirmed a 16‑point margin, comfortably above the lower‑bound 10‑point lead recorded by the AS/COA “Poll Tracker” and within the 12‑18‑point range projected by private surveys such as Cadem and Parametría. In short, Kast outperformed the most conservative poll expectations by roughly two to six points.

International reactions were swift and uniformly diplomatic. The United States Department of State congratulated Chile on a “peaceful, democratic election” and pledged cooperation on trade, security and regional stability. The European Union’s High Representative Josep Borrell echoed the sentiment, highlighting a “strong partnership” grounded in democratic values and market‑friendly reforms. Argentina’s President Sergio Massa also extended congratulations, signalling a willingness to deepen bilateral ties in energy and trade.

Financial markets mirrored the political optimism. Chile’s S&P‑Chile index (IPSA) jumped 3.1 % intra‑day, closing at 2 467 points, while the MSCI Chile index rose 2.8 %. The Chilean peso appreciated 0.5 % to roughly 795 per US dollar, and forward rates slipped to about 770, reflecting expectations of a stronger currency under a right‑wing administration. Sovereign yields fell, with the 10‑year benchmark dropping four basis points to 5.85 %, and US‑dollar‑denominated corporate bonds gained between 1.2 % and 1.5 %. Analysts such as Thierry Larose of Vontobel and Diego Celedon of JPMorgan described the outcome as “moderately bullish” for assets, noting that a right‑leaning but fragmented Congress should ease execution risk on pro‑market reforms.

The election thus marks a pivotal moment in Chile’s post‑protest era. Voters have opted for a candidate who promises to roll back the more expansive social agenda that followed the constitutional overhaul, favouring fiscal discipline and foreign investment. As the new administration prepares to take office, the immediate market response suggests that investors view the shift as a reduction in political risk, setting the stage for renewed growth prospects under a conservative helm.
