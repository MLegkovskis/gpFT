**Donald Trump’s “expansionist” blitz – a week that rattled Wall Street, sent oil prices tumbling and left policymakers scrambling**. From a ban on institutional investors in single‑family rentals to a sweeping tariff package, a $2 billion housing grant, a demand for lower Saudi oil prices and the re‑opening of the border wall, the former president’s flurry of executive orders between 5 January and 9 January 2026 provoked sharp partisan criticism and a cascade of market sell‑offs. Within five days the S&P 500 slipped 1.4 % after the REIT ban, futures on the Dow fell more than 2 % and crude‑oil futures dropped 4.1 % following the “Energy Independence” press conference, while defense stocks were hit after the wall order. The cumulative effect has been a palpable drag on short‑term growth expectations, even as some policy strands hint at modest longer‑term gains.

On 5 January Trump issued an executive order barring institutional investors – notably REITs and private‑equity funds – from purchasing single‑family rental (SFR) homes. Republican Senator Bernie Moreno pledged to codify the ban, while Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio‑Cortez denounced it as a reckless power grab that would hurt low‑income renters. Market reaction was swift: SFR‑related REITs tumbled 7.2 % and the broader S&P 500 slipped 1.4 % in after‑hours trading. JPMorgan analysts warned that the ban would cripple growth plans for SFR operators, casting doubt on the sector’s contribution to housing supply and, by extension, to GDP growth.

The following day, Trump unveiled a “Liberation Day” tariff regime – 25 % duties on steel and aluminium, new levies on Canadian oil, Mexican auto parts and a 20 % tariff on Chinese consumer goods. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries blasted the move as a recipe for recession, whereas Senator Marco Rubio hailed it as protection for American jobs. The market impact eclipsed the previous day’s sell‑off: Dow futures fell 2.2 % (about 900 points), S&P 500 futures dropped 3.4 % and Nasdaq‑100 futures slid 4.3 %. The Russell 2000 recorded a 1.3 % one‑day loss, confirming that the tariff shock reverberated across large‑ and small‑cap equities alike.

On 7 January Trump proposed a $2 billion “Housing Affordability Grant” for municipalities that limit SFR conversions. Governor Gavin Newsom dismissed the federal hand‑out as insufficient without zoning reform, while Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney welcomed the grant but warned the investor ban could backfire. Moody’s Analytics projected a modest 0.3 % rise in the national home‑ownership rate by 2028 if the grant were fully funded, suggesting a potential, albeit limited, positive contribution to the housing component of GDP.

The 8 January press conference on “Energy Independence” saw Trump press Saudi Arabia for lower oil prices and urge the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its 29 January meeting. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged restraint, and Senator Elizabeth Warren warned that the president lacks authority to dictate foreign oil pricing. Crude‑oil futures fell 4.1 % after the remarks, while the U.S. dollar index rose 0.6 %. The Fed’s minutes on 9 January signalled a high probability of holding rates steady at 5.25 %, underscoring that the president’s push for a rate cut had not yet swayed monetary policy.

Trump capped the week on 9 January by signing an order to re‑open border‑wall construction, allocating $1.5 billion from the defence budget. Senator Ted Cruz celebrated the move as a security win; Ocasio‑Cortez reiterated her opposition, calling the wall a waste of taxpayer money. Defence‑sector stocks, led by Lockheed Martin, fell 2.1 % and the S&P 500 closed 0.8 % lower, even as Bloomberg estimated the order would create roughly 12 000 construction jobs over the next year.

Overall, the week’s whirlwind of executive actions has injected volatility into equity markets, pressured commodity prices and sharpened partisan divides. While the housing grant and wall construction may generate modest job gains, the immediate market backlash – especially from the tariff package and the REIT ban – suggests a short‑term drag on GDP growth. Analysts remain cautious, noting that the cumulative effect of these policies could temper economic momentum even as individual initiatives promise niche benefits.
