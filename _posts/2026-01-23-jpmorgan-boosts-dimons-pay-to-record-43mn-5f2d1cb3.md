# JPMorgan Boosts Dimon's Pay to Record $43 Million
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's pay package increased to $43 million for 2025, a 10.3% rise from 2024. The pay increase had a neutral-to-slightly-positive impact on JPMorgan's stock price, with a 0.5% gain on the announcement day.
## Impact on Banking Sector Revenue
The record pay package is expected to have a positive effect on the overall banking sector's revenue numbers this quarter. With Dimon's pay explicitly tied to JPMorgan's record revenue and profitability, other large banks may feel pressure to lift quarterly revenue growth targets. This could lead to an increase in sector-wide revenue, potentially by $3.8 billion.
## Key Numbers
* $43 million: Dimon's pay package for 2025
* 10.3%: Increase in Dimon's pay package from 2024
* 0.5%: Gain in JPMorgan's stock price on the announcement day
* $3.8 billion: Potential increase in sector-wide revenue this quarter
