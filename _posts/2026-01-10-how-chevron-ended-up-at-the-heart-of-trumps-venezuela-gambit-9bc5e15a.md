**Chevron’s century‑long foothold in Venezuela has become the linchpin of a political gambit that sees successive U.S. administrations swing between sanction and sanction‑relief, using the company’s minority stake as both carrot and stick.** From a pioneering well in Lake Maracaibo in 1924 to a contested licence that vanished in February 2025, Chevron is the only U.S. oil major still operating in a country whose oil revenue underpins the Maduro regime.

The origins of this entanglement trace back to the early days of American oil expansion. Gulf Oil’s Venezuelan subsidiary, the forerunner of today’s Chevron, drilled its first well at Lake Maracaibo in 1924 and discovered the Boscan field in 1946, a billion‑barrel reservoir that cemented a permanent U.S. presence. When President Carlos Andrés Pérez nationalised the sector in 1976, creating PDVSA, Chevron, like its peers, entered a 50‑50 joint‑venture model, retaining a 40 % equity interest. The 1990s saw a modest re‑privatisation, and Chevron moved into the Orinoco Belt’s Carabobo blocks to exploit extra‑heavy crude, positioning itself for a future supply of low‑cost, high‑sulphur oil.

The turning point arrived under Hugo Chávez. In 2007 the government demanded majority ownership of foreign assets; while Exxon, ConocoPhillips and others withdrew, Chevron negotiated to keep a 40 % stake, becoming the sole U.S. oil company to remain on the ground. This survival gave it a strategic advantage when U.S. sanctions were imposed on PDVSA between 2014 and 2017, slashing Venezuelan exports to the United States by more than half. An August 2017 Trump administration sanction cut off most U.S. purchases, and an April 2020 executive order forced Chevron to wind down production, although imports had already fallen to zero.

A reversal came under President Biden. In October 2022 a general licence eased restrictions, allowing Chevron to resume limited production, and by January 2023 Venezuelan crude flowed again to Gulf‑Coast refineries. Output peaked at 100‑150 k barrels per day, a modest share of Chevron’s global 3 m bpd portfolio but vital for refineries tuned to extra‑heavy oil. The company’s joint‑venture was estimated to generate roughly one‑third of Venezuela’s oil revenue, making it a financial lifeline for the Maduro government.

The political stakes resurfaced when Donald Trump reclaimed the presidency in 2024. In July 2023, the former president boasted that “Chevron’s in Venezuela because I wanted them to be there,” underscoring how his personal influence had become entwined with corporate strategy. In February 2025 Trump revoked Chevron’s licence and imposed a 25 % tariff on any Venezuelan oil, forcing the firm to shut down once more and erasing a $3.6 bn quarterly profit derived from heavy crude. Throughout 2024 Chevron spent $6.67 million on U.S. lobbying to protect its interests, highlighting the intensity of the corporate‑political battle.

Chevron’s trajectory—from pioneer to partner, survivor of nationalisation, and finally the sole conduit for U.S. oil from Venezuela—mirrors the broader arc of American oil companies in the country. Its unique position has turned the firm into a lever that successive administrations wield to pressure or reward the Maduro regime. As long as the joint‑venture continues to fund a significant slice of Venezuela’s oil income, Chevron will remain at the centre of any U.S. strategy that seeks to use energy as a diplomatic tool.
