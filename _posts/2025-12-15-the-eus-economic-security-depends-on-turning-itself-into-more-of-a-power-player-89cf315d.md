**The EU’s economic security depends on turning itself into more of a power player**

The European Union has moved from a reactive rescue operation in the 2008 financial crisis to a proactive, security‑oriented doctrine that treats economic interdependence as a geopolitical vulnerability. The new EU Economic Security Strategy, refreshed in December 2025, seeks to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers, build strategic capacity in raw materials, semiconductors, AI and defence, and embed risk‑calculation tools across the single market. By doing so, the Union hopes to secure its supply chains, protect against coercive foreign actors and position itself as a decisive global economic power.

In 2008 the response was centred on stabilising banks and reviving demand. The European Economic Recovery Plan earmarked €200 bn of public‑investment guarantees and €30 bn of EU‑level financing, while the ECB cut rates by 325 basis points to a historic low of 1 %. Coordination was ad‑hoc, with a crisis unit and monthly finance‑minister meetings. By contrast, the 2025 strategy is anchored in a permanent Economic Security unit within the Commission and a risk‑assessment process feeding the European Preparedness Strategy. It does not rely on a single budget line but commits €30 bn to the RESourceEU plan and aligns with the €43 bn Strategic Autonomy fund for defence and technology.

The shift is also linguistic. The 2008 plan spoke of “stabilising banks” and “protecting jobs”, whereas the 2025 doctrine talks of “protect‑partner” and “protecting the EU against foreign economic coercion”. Ursula von der Leyen warned that the Union faces “imperial ambitions and hostile actors”, urging a new economic foreign policy that links internal tools with an outward‑facing agenda. Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič echoed the sentiment, insisting that “openness without security becomes vulnerability”.

Key policy tools now include the RESourceEU action plan, the CHIPS 2.0 Act for semiconductor fabs, and the Cloud & AI Development Act for sovereign digital infrastructure. Existing instruments such as state aid, procurement rules and export controls are deployed in a more proactive toolbox. The strategy also expands the Anti‑Coercion Instrument, the Foreign Subsidies Regulation and a strengthened investment‑screening regime, which screened 1 212 foreign‑direct‑investment cases in 2024‑2025, 42 % involving Chinese or US investors in strategic sectors.

Quantitative warnings underscore the urgency. Roughly 30 % of the EU’s rare‑earth imports come from China, and the European Parliament warned that failure to de‑risk rare‑earth and semiconductor inputs by 2027 could shave 0.4 % off GDP – about €200 bn annually. Conversely, the €15 bn Scale‑up Europe Fund aims to co‑invest in 120 strategic start‑ups, potentially creating 1 500 high‑tech jobs per year and offsetting up to 0.3 % of annual GDP loss.

The new doctrine also envisages a European Economic Security Council, bringing together representatives from all 27 Member States and Commission officials to produce a Strategic Dependency Dashboard every six months. This institutionalisation seeks to overcome the fragmented competence that hampered earlier crisis responses.

In sum, the EU has transformed its economic‑security outlook from short‑term crisis management to a long‑term, geopolitically aware strategy. By investing in critical sectors, tightening trade‑defence tools and fostering a unified decision‑making body, the Union aims to safeguard its market, reduce strategic dependencies and assert itself as a global power player.
