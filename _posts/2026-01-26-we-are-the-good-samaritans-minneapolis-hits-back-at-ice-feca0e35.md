# Minneapolis Hits Back at ICE
Minneapolis has taken a strong stance against ICE operations in the city, with a range of actions aimed at protecting residents and pushing back against federal immigration authorities. The city has filed a joint lawsuit with the state of Minnesota and the city of Saint Paul, seeking to halt the ICE surge and obtain a restraining order.
## Key Actions
* A city policy update bars ICE from entering municipal premises without a judicial warrant.
* Dedicated supervisory staff have been assigned to monitor ICE activity, and the city is tracking 911 calls related to ICE.
* The city has also implemented a training program for employees and first responders on how to respond to ICE activity and protect resident rights.
## Community Response
The local community has responded with large-scale protests, including a city-wide 'Good Samaritans' rally that drew over 5,000 participants. Residents have also organized petitions, with over 3,000 signatures collected in support of the city's executive order barring ICE activity on municipal property.
## Political and Legal Implications
While the potential legal and political implications of Minneapolis' actions on its relationship with federal immigration authorities could not be researched due to an error, the city's stance has been met with a unified political front, grassroots mobilization, and legal escalation.
