**A restaurant that restored my faith in tasting menus — Jay Rayner visits Vetch in Liverpool**

## Vetch: Liverpool’s new benchmark for tasting‑menu dining  

Vetch, the 29a Hope Street venue that earned two AA rosettes and a place on the Michelin Guide’s “Top 100 Restaurants”, has convinced veteran critic Jay Rayner that the tasting‑menu format can still surprise and delight.  The chef‑owner, Daniel McGeorge, combines locally sourced Merseyside produce with technically precise, globally inspired techniques, delivering a £120 tasting menu (plus a £65 wine pairing) that feels both inventive and grounded.

## A menu built on contrast and precision  

The eight‑course programme opens with a cauliflower chawanmushi scented with truffle, then moves to a Korean‑glazed chicken wing served on crisp cucumber.  Mid‑way, a duck breast with beetroot and damson offers a sweet‑sour counterpoint, while a pear‑yoghurt‑chamomile sorbet cleanses the palate.  The finale – pumpkin purée caramelised with finger‑lime – showcases the chef’s willingness to push texture without sacrificing flavour.  All dishes are presented on minimalist white plates, allowing the colours of the produce to dominate.

## Service that educates without intruding  

Vetch’s front‑of‑house team, led by General Manager Georgia Goodman, adopts a “guide‑by‑choice” approach: diners receive a concise briefing on each course, optional wine notes, and a discreet 12.5 % service charge is added automatically.  Staff are well‑versed in the provenance of each ingredient, reinforcing the restaurant’s narrative of regional sustainability.

## Atmosphere and accessibility  

The dining room balances industrial chic with warm timber, creating a space that feels exclusive yet unpretentious.  Open Wednesday to Saturday (lunch 12:00‑15:00, dinner 17:00‑23:00), Vetch operates on a reservation‑only basis; tables fill within hours of release, reflecting strong demand from both local diners and visitors.  Contact details: 0151 394 3073 or info@vetchrestaurant.com.

## Why Rayner’s faith was restored  

Rayner, who has previously lamented the “formulaic” nature of many tasting menus, praised Vetch for its “uncompromising focus on flavour progression and narrative coherence”.  He highlighted the chef’s ability to marry technique with a clear sense of place, noting that the menu “feels like a conversation with the North‑West rather than a showcase of culinary tricks”.

## Verdict  

Vetch has re‑energised the tasting‑menu conversation in the UK.  Its blend of precise technique, regional ingredients, and thoughtful service makes it a must‑visit for anyone seeking a contemporary British tasting experience that still respects tradition.
