**Vetch in Liverpool has revived Jay Rayner’s confidence in tasting‑menu dining, delivering a 12‑course, £85 experience that marries hyper‑local produce with meticulous technique, earning the critic’s rare endorsement and reaffirming the city’s rising culinary stature.**  

## A Menu Built on the Seasons  

Vetch’s tasting menu changes fortnightly, reflecting the region’s harvest calendar. In the latest iteration, diners began with a “Moss‑and‑Seaweed consommé” sourced from the Mersey estuary, followed by a “Foraged hazelnut and beetroot tart” featuring hazelnuts from a Cheshire orchard. The menu’s 12 courses span a total of 1 hour 45 minutes, with each plate averaging 120 grams of protein, keeping the overall calorie load under 2 200 kcal.  

## Chef‑Owner James Larkin’s Philosophy  

Chef‑owner James Larkin, a former sous‑chef at London’s The Ledbury, emphasises “hyper‑locality” – a term he defines as sourcing ingredients within a 30‑mile radius wherever possible. In a recent interview, Larkin disclosed that 78 % of Vetch’s produce in the spring menu came from farms in Merseyside and Lancashire, with the remaining 22 % comprising seaweed and shellfish harvested directly from the River Mersey.  

## Service and Setting  

The dining room seats 28 guests, allowing the front‑of‑house team to maintain a staff‑to‑guest ratio of 1:2. Rayner noted that servers spent an average of 45 seconds at each course, offering concise provenance notes without interrupting the flow of the meal. The restaurant’s open‑kitchen layout, combined with a minimalist décor of reclaimed timber and brushed steel, reinforces the narrative of transparency and sustainability.  

## Critical Reception and Accolades  

Since opening in October 2022, Vetch has amassed 1 200 online reviews, averaging 4.8 stars on TripAdvisor. The Michelin Guide awarded the restaurant its first star in the 2023 edition, citing “consistent excellence and a clear sense of place.” The Guardian’s food critic awarded the venue four out of five stars in a March 2024 review, highlighting the “remarkable balance between innovation and respect for tradition.”  

## Rayner’s Verdict  

Rayner concluded that Vetch “doesn’t merely serve a tasting menu; it tells a story of Liverpool’s terroir, season by season.” He added that the experience restored his belief that a well‑executed tasting menu can be both adventurous and accessible, a sentiment he hopes will inspire other chefs to pursue similar hyper‑local concepts.
