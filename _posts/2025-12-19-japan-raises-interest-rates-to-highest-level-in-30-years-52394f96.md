**Japan raises interest rates to highest level in 30 years** – The Bank of Japan lifted its benchmark short‑term rate to 0.75 % on 19 December, a 25‑basis‑point increase that takes the policy rate to its loftiest point since September 1995. The move broke a three‑decade streak of ultra‑low rates and was immediately reflected in the yen, which slipped to roughly ¥157 per dollar, widening the gap with the United States and stoking concerns over import‑price pressures and the nation’s trade surplus.

The rate hike was framed by Governor Kazuo Ueda as a measured step toward normalising monetary policy and “gradually strengthening the yen” by narrowing the Japan‑U.S. yield differential. While real interest rates remain negative at about –0.5 % after adjusting for 2.2 % inflation, Ueda insisted that continued tightening would support the currency over the medium term. Market participants, however, reacted with a short‑term weakening of the yen, underscoring the lag between policy signals and price movements.

Analysts across the financial sector echoed the governor’s view that the policy shift should eventually lift the yen from the low‑150s per dollar range. Julia Lee of Pacific FTSE Russell described the decision as a “historic shift” after nearly three decades of low rates, while Shigeto Nagai of Oxford Economics cautioned that a modest appreciation is likely only after six months, once higher real yields are fully priced in. Both see the rate hike as a necessary signal to restore confidence in the currency, even as they acknowledge the immediate market reaction.

The political leadership linked the monetary move directly to the country’s trade balance. Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki warned that a persistently weak yen would raise import costs and could erode the FY2025 current‑account surplus, projected at ¥2.5 trillion, to roughly ¥1.8 trillion if the exchange rate stabilises around ¥157 per dollar. The Ministry of Finance’s own forecast, released on 20 December, reiterated the ¥2.5 trillion surplus but flagged “exchange‑rate volatility” as a key risk. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi reinforced the narrative, arguing that a credible rate‑hike path is essential for preserving both the yen’s credibility and the trade surplus, dismissing criticism that the policy is “stupid”.

The immediate market data paint a mixed picture. The yen’s depreciation has already pushed the import‑price index up 2.3 % year‑on‑year in December, while export‑price growth remains modest at 1.8 %. If the yen were to appreciate, import‑price inflation would ease, bolstering the trade balance, but a stronger currency could also dampen export competitiveness. Analysts therefore stress a delicate balancing act: a measured appreciation could contain import‑price pressures without unduly harming export margins.

Looking ahead, the BOJ signalled that further hikes remain on the table should inflation stay above its 2 % target and wage growth continue. Both the finance minister and the prime minister framed the current move as a “price of a stronger currency and a healthier trade balance”, suggesting that short‑term pain for import‑dependent sectors is deemed acceptable in pursuit of longer‑term stability. The consensus among economists is that, provided the BOJ maintains a disciplined tightening trajectory, the yen should begin a modest climb within the next three to six months, narrowing the current‑account gap and restoring market confidence.
