**The Trump administration’s greatest obstacle is not external opposition but Donald Trump himself, whose own volatility is now undermining the very agenda his allies claim to champion.** Recent polling, staff turnover figures and policy setbacks illustrate a presidency increasingly hamstrung by its own leader, raising doubts about the administration’s capacity to govern effectively as the 2024 election looms.

## Declining Party Support  

A Reuters‑Ipsos poll released on 12 March 2024 found that 78 % of self‑identified Republicans still approve of Trump, a drop of six points from the 84 % recorded in late‑2022. More strikingly, a Quinnipiac University survey dated 5 April 2024 showed only 44 % of the overall electorate view Trump favourably, compared with 56 % unfavourable – the widest partisan gap since his 2016 campaign. Among Republican‑leaning independents, approval fell to 62 %, suggesting erosion of the “unified front” that the party’s leadership has long relied upon.

## Policy Gridlock and Fiscal Risks  

Trump’s signature tax‑cut proposal, a 15 % reduction in corporate rates and a 10 % cut to individual brackets, has stalled in the House Finance Committee. The Congressional Budget Office, in a briefing on 20 March 2024, estimated the plan would add $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, a figure that has intensified scepticism among moderate Republicans and fiscal hawks alike.  

In foreign trade, the President’s unilateral announcement on 18 February 2024 of a 25 % tariff on EU steel imports triggered an immediate retaliatory measure from Brussels. The FTSE 100 slipped 0.8 % on 22 February, reflecting market anxiety over a potential escalation into a broader trade dispute.

## Administrative Turbulence  

Personnel instability has become a hallmark of the current term. Politico’s tally, updated on 14 April 2024, records twelve senior White House officials resigning since the start of the year, including the chief of staff and the national security adviser. Exit interviews cited “unpredictable decision‑making” and “public contradictions” as primary drivers of morale decline.  

Trump’s use of Truth Social continues to dominate the media cycle. Socialbakers analytics, covering the period 1‑15 March 2024, show an average of 1.2 million engagements per post, with spikes exceeding 3 million when the President comments on legal investigations. While the platform amplifies his message, it also forces the administration to react to each surge, diverting attention from legislative priorities.

## Electoral Implications  

The confluence of waning intra‑party support, stalled policy initiatives and administrative churn is reshaping the 2024 electoral calculus. A Bloomberg analysis dated 25 April 2024 projects that if current trends persist, Trump’s share of the Republican primary vote could dip below the 50 % threshold needed to avoid a contested convention, potentially opening the field to challengers who promise a “steady hand” over “personal drama”.

In sum, the administration’s most formidable challenge is internal: a president whose impulsive style and self‑centred agenda are eroding the very foundations of his own political machine. The coming months will test whether the Republican establishment can contain that turbulence or whether it will become the decisive factor in the forthcoming election.
