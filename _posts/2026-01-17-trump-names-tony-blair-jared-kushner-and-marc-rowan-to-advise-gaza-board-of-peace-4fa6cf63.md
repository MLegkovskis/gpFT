**Donald Trump’s newly‑formed Gaza “Board of Peace”, announced on 16 January 2026, brings together a high‑profile roster – former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, ex‑White House adviser Jared Kushner, Apollo Global chief Marc Rowan and senior politicians such as Marco Rubio – with the stated aim of steering Gaza’s post‑war reconstruction, governance capacity‑building and investment attraction. The board’s mandate, outlined in a White House press release, is to oversee a “defined portfolio critical to Gaza’s stabilisation and long‑term success”, ranging from large‑scale funding mobilisation to regional relations. While the initiative signals an unprecedented blend of political, multilateral and private‑sector expertise, its economic impact hinges on the realisation of the United Nations’ $15 billion reconstruction estimate – an amount roughly five times Gaza’s 2022 nominal GDP of $3.1 billion and comparable to a full year of its PPP‑adjusted output.**

If the board can marshal the full UN‑projected sum, the average annual injection would be about $3 billion over five years, effectively matching Gaza’s pre‑war nominal GDP each year. The financing blueprint is deliberately vague: “large‑scale funding and capital mobilisation” will be pursued through a mix of U.S. government backing, World Bank channels – represented by President Ajay Banga – and private‑sector capital led by Rowan’s network. No concrete budget has been disclosed, leaving the scale of actual disbursements uncertain.

The Board’s structure echoes the Oslo Accords of the early 1990s, which created a Palestinian Authority as an interim governing body under a five‑year timetable. Both frameworks rely on an external supervisory entity – Oslo’s U.S.‑mediated bilateral agreement and the 2026 Board’s multilateral composition – to manage a transitional administration. However, the Board diverges by expanding the stakeholder pool to include regional ministers from Turkey, Qatar, Egypt and the UAE, and by embedding private‑equity expertise directly into the reconstruction agenda. This broader geographic representation could address one of Oslo’s shortcomings: the exclusion of key regional actors that later undermined the peace process.

Historical experience offers cautionary lessons. Oslo’s failure is widely attributed to a lack of local legitimacy – Hamas and other factions were sidelined – and to an open‑ended timeline that allowed “mission creep”. The Board similarly omits Palestinian civil‑society voices and women, raising concerns about its acceptance among Gaza’s population. Moreover, the absence of a fixed end‑date mirrors the indefinite “transitional” label that plagued earlier post‑conflict administrations, risking prolonged external oversight without clear milestones.

Security arrangements also warrant scrutiny. Oslo granted Israel de‑facto control over borders and security zones, fostering Palestinian mistrust. In the 2026 plan, United Nations Security Council Resolution 2675 (mid‑November 2025) authorises an International Stabilisation Force to operate under the Board’s guidance. The force’s perceived neutrality will be pivotal; any perception of bias could repeat Oslo’s security‑politics impasse.

Funding mechanisms present both opportunity and risk. While Oslo’s donor pledges of $5 billion in the 1990s were fragmented and often unreleased, the Board’s inclusion of a billionaire financier and the World Bank suggests a shift toward structured, market‑driven investment. Yet without transparent accountability, the “large‑scale funding” promise may fall into the same pledge‑but‑no‑delivery pattern that stalled earlier reconstruction efforts.

In sum, the Gaza Board of Peace embodies a modernised, multilateral take on the interim governance model first tried in Oslo. Its success will depend on securing genuine local legitimacy, defining clear, time‑bound objectives, ensuring a balanced security framework and translating lofty financing rhetoric into tangible, monitored disbursements. If these conditions are met, the $15 billion reconstruction envelope could transform Gaza’s economy; if not, the board risks becoming another well‑publicised but ineffective peace‑building experiment.
