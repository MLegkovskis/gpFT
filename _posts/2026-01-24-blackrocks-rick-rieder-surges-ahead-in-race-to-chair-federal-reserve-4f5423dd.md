# Introduction to Rick Rieder's Potential Fed Chairmanship
Rick Rieder, BlackRock's CIO of Global Fixed Income, has emerged as the front-runner to chair the Federal Reserve. His potential leadership could have significant implications for US monetary policy and interest rates.
## Implications of Rieder's Leadership
Rieder's bond-market background and public advocacy for lower mortgage rates suggest a higher probability of Fed rate cuts once inflation is comfortably at or below 2%. A 75- to 125-basis-point reduction in the federal-funds rate could lift real GDP growth in 2026-27 by roughly 0.4-0.8 percentage points.
## Expected Macroeconomic Impact

* A 0.4-0.8 percentage point increase in US real GDP growth in 2026-27
* Higher employment, with a 0.1-0.2 percentage point reduction in the unemployment rate
* Slightly higher inflation, with a 0.1-0.2 percentage point increase in PCE inflation
* Increased federal revenues, with a $30-45 billion increase in tax receipts per 0.1% of real GDP growth
## Conclusion
In conclusion, Rieder's potential chairmanship of the Federal Reserve could have significant implications for US monetary policy and interest rates. His leadership could lead to a more accommodative monetary stance, with lower mortgage rates and a modest housing-market stimulus.
