**Indonesia has deployed the armed forces to accelerate forest‑clearing, a programme funded from a Rp 6.039 trillion (≈ US $368 million) forestry budget line and deemed unlikely to dent the nation’s 5.4 % GDP growth target for 2026.** 

The Ministry of Forestry announced on 15 July 2025 that the military would be mobilised to speed up the removal of degraded forest areas, a task traditionally handled by civilian crews. The operation is financed entirely within the ministry’s 2026 budget ceiling, which totals Rp 6.039 trillion. By embedding the cost in the existing forestry allocation, the government avoids creating a separate defence‑budget line and sidesteps any need for additional borrowing.

Indonesia’s 2026 state budget, approved by parliament on 23 September 2025, is projected at US $230.5 billion, with a defence allocation of Rp 335.3 trillion (≈ US $23.4 billion). The forest‑clearing programme therefore represents roughly 0.16 % of the total budget. In terms of gross domestic product, the US $368 million outlay is estimated to be about 0.02 % of the country’s projected 2026 GDP of US $1.4 trillion. Economic analysts at Nomura Global Markets, writing in September 2025, concluded that such a marginal fiscal commitment “is unlikely to materially affect the 5.4 % growth target,” especially given that the funding is drawn from an already‑approved line rather than new debt.

The decision reflects Jakarta’s broader pro‑growth stance, which seeks to balance environmental restoration with economic expansion. By tasking the TNI with clearing degraded lands, the government hopes to accelerate re‑planting and land‑use conversion, thereby unlocking agricultural and industrial potential on sites previously deemed unproductive. The move also signals a willingness to employ unconventional tools to meet the ambitious targets set out in the 2026 budget, which aims to raise growth from 5.2 % in 2025 to 5.4 % the following year.

Critics may argue that militarising forest management could raise governance concerns, yet the financial analysis suggests the policy’s macro‑economic footprint will be negligible. The operation’s cost is dwarfed by the defence budget and constitutes a tiny slice of overall public spending. Consequently, the fiscal risk to Indonesia’s growth outlook is minimal, and the programme is unlikely to trigger any significant re‑rating by international investors or multilateral lenders.

In sum, the deployment of the armed forces to clear forests is a financially modest initiative, absorbed within the forestry ministry’s budget and projected to have no discernible impact on Indonesia’s 2026 growth trajectory. The policy underscores the government’s determination to fast‑track land‑use reforms while keeping the macro‑economic balance intact.
