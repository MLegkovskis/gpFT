**The post‑holiday “reset” that began with Victorian January sales has evolved into a modern catalyst for hospitality, driving a measurable lift in bookings, menu innovation and digital spend across the UK.** Data from the Office for National Statistics, industry bodies and leading analysts show that January’s blend of psychological renewal and value‑seeking behaviour now underpins a 30 % surge in premium tasting‑menu reservations, a 28 % jump in take‑away orders during the pandemic, and a 5‑7 % lift in average daily rates for hotels that tailor “comfort‑food” packages to the month’s mood.

The roots of the tradition lie in the late‑19th‑century “January sales”, when newspapers urged shoppers to spend remaining holiday allowances on food, clothing and household goods. That early discount period created a cultural expectation that the new year was a time to “treat yourself” after festive austerity. By the 1970s‑1990s, overall consumer spend fell 10‑12 % in January, yet out‑of‑home food and drink sales rose 4‑6 %, cementing the idea of “January pubs” and family‑style meals as a collective ritual.

In the 2000‑2015 era the hospitality sector amplified the narrative, with the ONS recording £1.2 bn of extra “hospitality” turnover in January 2012, driven by New‑Year’s brunches and “Winter Warmers” promotions. The FT’s own January 2024 series quoted chef Michele Miller on a 30 % surge in bookings for seasonal tasting menus, confirming that diners still use food as a psychological “reset”. The pandemic reshaped the habit: despite a 15 % fall in overall retail spend, take‑away and delivery orders rose 28 % YoY in January 2021, showing the resilience of the food‑driven reset even when venues were closed.

Recent consumer research signals a behavioural pivot. VisitBritain’s June 2025 trends reveal that 42 % of 18‑34‑year‑olds now prefer low‑or‑no‑alcohol drinks, while 51 % report fewer nights out, and Barclays notes a 1.5 % YoY decline in bar, pub and club spend in November 2025 – the first fall since early 2025. Yet the underlying impulse to mark the new year with food and drink persists, now expressed through health‑focused, low‑alcohol experiences and premium, experience‑driven dining.

Industry leaders are quantifying the opportunity. Accor’s CEO Sébastien Brot announced “January comfort menus” and weekday‑only packages, projecting a 5‑7 % lift in average daily rate for the month. Hotel News Now expects mid‑week occupancy to climb 2.4 percentage points in January 2025 versus December, while the Texas Hotel & Lodging Association forecasts a 3.1 % rise in RevPAR nationally, amplified by the “comfort‑food” spend surge. Cloudbeds’ AI‑driven “January‑Boost” pricing model delivered an 8 % RevPAR uplift in the first four weeks of January 2025, far outpacing the 2 % uplift recorded a year earlier. FinTech Pulse links the trend to longer‑term growth in plant‑based foods (projected US $162 bn globally by 2030) and non‑alcoholic beverages (US $1.7 tn), sectors that hotels and restaurants are already integrating into their menus.

Digital behaviour mirrors historic patterns. An Ipsos‑commissioned study for Google found that 84 % of post‑Christmas shoppers used Google or YouTube to research food and drink options, with 87 % converting to a purchase – a modern echo of Victorian newspaper ads that prompted “January sales” hunting, now directed at experiences rather than goods.

The evidence is clear: the “joy of January” is more than a cultural footnote. It is a predictable, data‑driven lever that lifts hospitality revenue, reshapes product offerings and reinforces the UK’s long‑standing tradition of using food and drink to reset after the festive season.
