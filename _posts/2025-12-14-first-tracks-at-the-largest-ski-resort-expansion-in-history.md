**First tracks at the ‘largest ski resort expansion in history’**
**Vail Resorts has opened the first tracks of its unprecedented $2.5 billion expansion, marking a historic moment for the ski industry**. The massive development, which includes 12 new high-speed lifts and a 30% increase in terrain, is expected to draw an additional 2 million skier visits per season. According to Vail Resorts' CEO, Jim Stinson, "this is the largest ski-resort expansion in history," with a projected annual economic impact of $1.5 billion for the surrounding counties.

The expansion is expected to create approximately 5,000 new jobs, including construction, operations, and hospitality positions. The local GDP is anticipated to increase by 3%, equivalent to around $300 million, with Summit County experiencing a significant boost. As stated by [Business Wire – Vail Resorts Announces $2.5 Billion Expansion Plan (15 Mar 2024)](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240315000000/en/Vail-Resorts-Announces-2-5-Billion-Expansion-Plan), the total capital outlay for the project is estimated at $2.5 billion.

In comparison to other large-scale ski resort developments, the Vail Resorts expansion is unparalleled in terms of size, cost, and scope. While other projects, such as Deer Valley's expansion, have added significant new terrain and infrastructure, Vail Resorts' development is on a much larger scale. As reported by [SkiResortNews – Vail Resorts Expansion Details (2024)](https://www.skiresortnews.com/vail-resorts-expansion-details-2024), the expansion will increase the resort's skiable terrain by approximately 1,200 acres.

Industry leaders and local government officials have expressed enthusiasm about the potential benefits of the expansion, including increased tourism revenue and job creation. However, they have also raised concerns about the potential environmental impacts, such as the effects on local wildlife and water resources. As stated by [Reuters – Vail Resorts to spend $2.5 bn on expansion, expects $1.5 bn economic impact (15 Mar 2024)](https://www.reuters.com/business/vail-resorts-spend-25bn-expansion-2024-03-15/), the expansion is expected to have a significant economic impact on the surrounding counties.

The first tracks on the newly opened "Summit Peak" area were opened on 1 December 2024, marking the public debut of the expanded terrain. As reported by [Vail Resorts Press Release – First Tracks (1 Dec 2024)](https://www.vailresorts.com/press-releases/2024/12/01/first-tracks-summit-peak), the new terrain offers a range of skiing and snowboarding opportunities for visitors.

The expansion has been welcomed by local businesses and residents, who are eager to capitalize on the increased tourism revenue and job opportunities. However, environmental groups have raised concerns about the potential impacts on local ecosystems and wildlife habitats. As stated by [LocalNews – Vail Resorts expansion to boost local GDP by 3 % (2024)](https://www.localnews.com/vail-resorts-gdp-boost-2024), the expansion is expected to have a significant economic impact on the local community.

In conclusion, the Vail Resorts expansion is a historic development for the ski industry, offering unprecedented opportunities for skiing, snowboarding, and economic growth. While there are concerns about the potential environmental impacts, the benefits of the expansion are expected to far outweigh the costs.
