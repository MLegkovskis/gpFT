**Minsk has freed Nobel‑Peace‑Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski and 122 other political detainees as Washington lifts its sanctions on Belarus’s potash sector, a move that analysts say could add up to 1 % to the country’s GDP in 2026 and lay the groundwork for a tentative thaw in U‑S‑Minsk relations.** 

The prisoner release, announced on 13 December 2025, included opposition leader Maria Kolesnikova and marked the largest single amnesty in Belarus since the 2020 protests. The United States simultaneously announced the immediate removal of restrictions on Belarusian potash exports – a commodity that once accounted for roughly 20 % of global trade and 7.3 % of Belarus’s GDP before sanctions curbed the sector.

U.S. Special Envoy for Belarus John Coale hailed the developments as “constructive steps” that reflect Minsk’s willingness to engage in a more stable and cooperative relationship with Washington. In a press briefing in Minsk, Coale said the potash sanctions were being lifted “effective immediately” and hinted that “more sanctions will be lifted” should Belarus demonstrate genuine progress on human‑rights issues. The State Department’s written statement echoed this sentiment, describing the release of Bialiatski as a “constructive step” that opens the door to deeper bilateral ties.

Belarusian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Evgeny Shestakov framed the twin actions as reciprocal gestures. He told state news agency BELTA that the release of the Nobel laureate “confirms the willingness of the Belarusian side to engage in dialogue with the United States” and that the potash‑sanctions lift is an “important element of the broader process of normalising our bilateral relations.” The ministry’s official communiqué added that the developments “open the way for further cooperation in trade, security and humanitarian issues.”

Economists estimate that the sanctions had previously shaved roughly 5 % off Belarus’s GDP, with the potash sector alone contributing 7.3 % of output before the curbs. Analyst Anastasiya Luzgina of the Belarusian Research and Consulting Centre (BEROC) projects that reinstating the U.S. market could boost annual growth by 0.5 %‑1 % in 2026, mirroring the 0.5 % cushion identified by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in its pre‑sanctions baseline. If the sector regains a 12‑15 % share of the global potash market by 2028 – still below the pre‑sanctions 20 % but well above the 6 % level recorded in 2024 – the cumulative contribution to GDP could rise by an additional 1.5 %‑2.5 % over three years.

The projected rebound hinges on the restoration of export channels that were previously blocked for U.S. buyers, as well as renewed access to financing and insurance for shipments to third‑party markets. Luzgina stresses that the “favourable effect” of lifting sanctions will be modest but measurable, translating into a “boost to GDP” that could help offset the broader economic drag caused by Western measures since the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Both Washington and Minsk present the episode as a confidence‑building exchange, yet the path ahead remains uncertain. While the United States signals a willingness to consider further relief, it has made clear that any additional easing will be contingent on demonstrable improvements in Belarus’s human‑rights record. Minsk, for its part, appears eager to leverage the potash reprieve to attract foreign investment and revive a sector that underpins the nation’s agricultural export earnings.

The release of Ales Bialiatski, a symbol of Belarusian civil society, coupled with the potash‑sanctions lift, therefore represents more than a humanitarian gesture; it is a calculated economic and diplomatic maneuver that could reshape Minsk’s engagement with the West, albeit incrementally and under close scrutiny.
