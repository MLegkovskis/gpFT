# Beijing Backs Brain Implant Push to Rival Elon Musk’s Neuralink
Beijing is backing a brain implant push to rival Elon Musk’s Neuralink, with a government-coordinated, multi-tiered stack that starts with a 256-electrode, BLE-linked, inductively powered Beinao-1 implant. The emphasis is on rapid clinical scaling, lower-cost manufacturing, and a clear regulatory timetable.
## Comparison with Neuralink
Neuralink’s approach focuses on maximal channel count, high-bandwidth wireless streaming, and a robotic insertion that promises ultra-fine placement but adds surgical complexity. Beijing’s Beinao-1 trades raw channel density for simpler surgery, continuous inductive power, and a state-backed scaling plan.
## Regulatory Timeline
The Chinese government has issued guidelines for brain chip research and is providing funding for BCI development. The government aims to achieve breakthrough BCI by 2027 and have an internationally competitive industry by 2030.
