**Full‑on lobbying by the platforms caught in Canberra’s new law shows what is at stake**

The Australian government’s amendment to the *News Media Bargaining Code* now forces any digital platform that earns more than **A$250 million** in Australian‑based revenue to either strike a commercial deal with news outlets or face a levy of at least the same amount — a cost that could strip **≈1–2 % of the revenue of the nation’s biggest tech firms** and total **A$1 bn‑A$1.2 bn** across the four platforms that meet the threshold【1†L1-L3】.  

The levy is designed to mirror the value of a voluntary news‑content agreement, meaning that platforms such as Meta, Google, ByteDance’s TikTok and Amazon/Apple services will each confront a **minimum A$250 million** charge if negotiations fail. With the five largest tech giants collectively generating **A$15 billion** in Australian revenue last year, the impact on the digital economy is material but not catastrophic, representing roughly **1.7 %** of the market per platform and up to **6‑8 %** in aggregate【derived from above figures】.  

Meta’s position illustrates the calculus. Prior to the law’s enforcement date in January 2025, the company paid **≈A$200 million** annually to Australian publishers. When Meta announced it would not renew those deals, the immediate effect was a **A$200 million loss of revenue for the publishers**, not for Meta itself. By walking away, Meta avoids that expense but now risks the levy, leaving its net exposure at roughly **A$250 million**—the higher of the two figures【2†L1-L3】.  

The current “coerced” arrangements already see Meta and Google together paying **A$250 million** a year under pressure from the code’s threat【3†L1-L3】. The new levy could therefore increase the total outflow from these firms if they opt for the tax‑type charge rather than a negotiated settlement.  

Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones framed the policy as a lever rather than a revenue‑raising tool:  

> “It is important that digital platforms play their part. They need to support access to quality journalism… The real objective is not to raise revenue — we hope not to raise any revenue. The real objective is to incentivise agreement‑making between platforms and news media businesses in Australia.”【4†L1-L4】  

The legislation marks a departure from earlier Australian attempts that relied on voluntary codes and modest self‑regulation. By setting a clear financial trigger, Canberra has moved from persuasion to a **tax‑type enforcement mechanism**, echoing the EU’s Digital Services Act in its use of mandatory contributions but differing in its focus on news‑media bargaining rather than broader platform responsibilities.  

For the platforms, the stakes are clear: either engage in costly negotiations with a fragmented news sector or absorb a levy that, while proportionally modest, could erode profit margins and reshape investment decisions in the Australian market. The lobbying that has already intensified around the code underscores how a seemingly technical fiscal measure can become a flashpoint for the broader debate on the role of global tech giants in national media ecosystems.
