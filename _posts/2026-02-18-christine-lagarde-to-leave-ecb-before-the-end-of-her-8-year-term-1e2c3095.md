### Christine Lagarde to Leave ECB Before End of Term
The European stock market, particularly the Euro Stoxx 50 index, has shown a muted reaction to the news of Christine Lagarde's potential early exit from the European Central Bank (ECB). On the day of the report, Euro Stoxx 50 futures dipped by -0.4% and the spot index declined by -0.3%. This move was modest compared to typical volatility spikes around major macro-policy announcements.

The ECB's monetary-policy framework is expected to remain unchanged, with the Governing Council's consensus on inflation-targeting and rate-path remaining intact. Consequently, the Euro Stoxx 50 is expected to stay within its existing trend band (≈4,150-4,300 points) barring other macro shocks.

Historical precedent suggests that leadership changes at the ECB have been absorbed by the market when policy continuity is credible. For example, Mario Draghi's 2019 departure produced a tiny positive bounce (+0.1%), while Trichet's 2007 exit caused only a -0.2% dip.

Market forecasts still project the Euro Stoxx 50 to reach 4,300-4,350 points by Q4 2026, assuming the ECB maintains its current 'gradual-tightening' stance. The Lagarde succession is priced in as a low-volatility event.
