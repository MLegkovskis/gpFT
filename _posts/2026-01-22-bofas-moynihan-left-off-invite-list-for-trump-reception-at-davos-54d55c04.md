### Bank of America's CEO Left Off Trump Reception Invite List
The exclusion of Bank of America's CEO Brian Moynihan from a reception hosted by former President Donald Trump at Davos has sparked concerns about the bank's relationship with the current administration. The snub, reported by the Financial Times, may signal a strained relationship between the bank and the administration, potentially leading to increased regulatory scrutiny and a shift in lobbying strategy.

### Potential Implications
The implications of this snub are far-reaching, with potential effects on the bank's regulatory climate, market reaction, lobbying and contributions, peer-bank dynamics, and reputational risk. The bank may face increased scrutiny from regulators, and its share price may be affected by investor concerns about the bank's political capital.

### Regulatory Exposure
The Biden administration has already tightened capital and stress-testing rules for large banks, and a perceived political misstep could lead to more aggressive supervisory reviews. Historical precedent suggests that banks perceived as politically out-of-step can expect a 10-15% increase in supervisory examination frequency.

### Competitive Disadvantage
The exclusion of Moynihan from the Trump reception, combined with the attendance of JPMorgan Chase's CEO Jamie Dimon, may widen the influence gap between the two largest U.S. banks. This could give JPMorgan a strategic advantage in shaping policy, such as the implementation schedule for the 'Basel IV' regulations.

### Market Perception
The immediate dip in Bank of America's share price, albeit modest, combined with analyst commentary, suggests that investors view the snub as a risk factor that could affect future earnings. The bank's estimated incremental compliance costs over the next two years could be $150-$200 million, according to Bloomberg's 'Banking Risk' model.
