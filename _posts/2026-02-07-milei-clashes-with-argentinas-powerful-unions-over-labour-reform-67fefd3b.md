# Milei's Labour Reform Proposal
President Javier Milei has introduced a labour reform package aimed at reducing the cost of hiring and lowering informality in Argentina. The proposal includes changes to severance pay, trial periods, and union power.

## Key Points of the Reform
* Severance pay will be reduced to 0.5 months' salary per year of service, capped at 12 months
* Trial periods will be extended to 6 months, with possible extensions to 8 or 12 months
* A new 'Independent Worker' category will be created, allowing individuals to hire up to 3 collaborators without being considered employees
* Union power will be curbed, with collective bargaining agreements requiring a majority vote of employees

## Union Response
The unions have responded strongly to the proposal, with the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) representing approximately 2 million workers. The CGT has stated that it will not accept fewer rights and is seeking more work and dignity for its members.

## Potential Impact
The clash between Milei and the unions could have significant implications for Argentina's political stability and social landscape. Possible outcomes include a general strike, legislative deadlock, and increased social polarization.
