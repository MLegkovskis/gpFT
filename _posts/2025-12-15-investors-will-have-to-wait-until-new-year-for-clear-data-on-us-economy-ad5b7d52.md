**Investors will have to wait until new year for clear data on US economy**

The United States is heading into the final quarter of 2025 with a patchwork of forecasts that all point to a modest slowdown, leaving market participants in a holding pattern until the official data arrive in early February 2026. Consensus projections for Q4 real‑GDP growth hover between 1.1 % and 2.1 % annualised, a range that will shave the calendar‑year expansion to just under 2 % – a level many analysts regard as the economy’s sustainable trend. With the Bureau of Economic Analysis postponing the advance estimate of Q4 output until February, investors must base decisions on a blend of private‑sector forecasts and a backlog of delayed labour‑market and inflation statistics.

The median outlook from the three most‑cited forecasters – S&P Global, the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Federal Reserve’s own FOMC table – suggests annual growth of 1.7 %‑1.9 % for 2025. S&P Global and Vanguard both raise the full‑year estimate to 1.9 % after accounting for a Q4 drag, while the New York Fed’s DSGE model places the quarter at 1.8 % (90 % range 0.9‑2.6 %). The consensus therefore signals earnings growth that will be modest across most sectors, favouring defensive and dividend‑paying stocks. Monetary‑policy expectations remain cautious; the Fed’s median projection of 1.7 % annual growth underpins a “wait‑and‑see” stance on rate cuts until the delayed data confirm whether the slowdown is temporary or structural.

The data vacuum stems largely from the 43‑day federal government shutdown that began at the end of October. The shutdown postponed the November employment report, the November CPI and PPI, and the October JOLTS release, compressing three months of labour‑market and inflation information into the December‑January window. Nomura chief economist David Seif warned that this catch‑up burst will span the two Fed meetings in December and January, creating heightened uncertainty. Fed Chair Jerome Powell echoed the sentiment, noting that despite the gaps “available public and private sector data suggest that the outlook for employment and inflation has not changed.” Yet the Fed’s own research on policy uncertainty warns that such gaps can depress industrial production by half a percentage point for up to 14 months, a risk that investors are keen to avoid.

The delayed releases are not unprecedented, but they are the longest since the 2013 shutdown. In 2025 the Employment Situation for September is postponed by 48 days, while the Q3 GDP estimate, durable‑goods orders and personal income figures are each delayed by roughly 27 days. By contrast, the 2018‑19 shutdown produced only a week‑long lag for the November jobs report, and the 2020 pandemic disruptions typically added two to three weeks. The current 27‑48 day postponements therefore represent a 2‑4‑fold increase in lag time, deepening the “data fog” that already clouds the Fed’s policy calendar.

For portfolio managers, the practical implication is a pause on large‑cap equity allocations and capital‑expenditure commitments until the December‑January data set arrives. The prevailing view is “cautious optimism”: earnings remain solid, but risk‑adjusted returns are uncertain without a clear picture of the labour market and inflation trajectory. On the policy front, the Fed is likely to maintain a modest stance – a 25‑basis‑point cut at the December meeting remains the most probable move, but any further easing in early 2026 will hinge on the post‑shutdown data. Powell’s repeated pledge to “wait and see” signals that the Fed will not rush to tighten or loosen policy until the statistical backlog is cleared.

In sum, the combination of a subdued Q4 outlook, a prolonged data delay, and a Fed that is deliberately patient creates a period of heightened vigilance for investors. The first weeks of 2026 will be decisive: once the BEA publishes the Q4 advance estimate and the BLS releases the postponed labour‑market figures, markets will finally have the evidence needed to price the next phase of US growth and monetary policy.
