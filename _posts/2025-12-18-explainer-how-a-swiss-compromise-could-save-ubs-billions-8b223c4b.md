**Explainer: How a Swiss compromise could save UBS billions**

A joint legislative proposal in Switzerland could slash UBS’s tax bill by roughly **CHF 1.2 billion** – a cut of about **55 %** of its current annual outlay – while simultaneously trimming a projected **$26 billion** capital surcharge to a range of **$10‑15 billion**. The combined effect would preserve between **$11‑16 billion** of capital for the bank, protect its European operations and, according to market reaction, lift its share price to the highest level since February 2008.

The tax element of the compromise centres on the treatment of deferred‑tax assets and software‑related tax credits. Under the new rules UBS would be allowed to count a portion of these intangible items as regulatory capital, a move analysts say would reduce the bank’s annual tax expense from **CHF 2.2 billion** to around **CHF 1.0 billion**. The saving mirrors the scale of the capital relief, reinforcing the argument that the proposal is a “more constructive direction” than the “extreme approach” previously advocated by the government.

From a capital‑adequacy perspective, the original regulatory assessment warned that UBS would need to raise an additional **$26 billion** to meet Basel‑III‑aligned buffers. The parliamentary draft caps the extra requirement at **$10‑15 billion**, meaning the bank could retain **$11‑16 billion** that would otherwise be tied up in high‑cost equity. By permitting the use of Additional Tier‑1 (AT1) bonds for foreign‑subsidiary capital, funding costs are expected to fall by **30‑40 basis points** compared with a pure equity solution. The market rewarded the prospect: UBS shares jumped **5 %** on 12 December, the strongest rally since the 2008 financial crisis, and settled about **3 %** higher in the following days.

Stakeholder reactions have been broadly supportive, albeit with caveats. UBS senior management welcomed the “targeted, proportionate and internationally aligned” approach, with Chief Risk Officer Markus Ronner describing the outlook as “optimistic”. Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller‑Sutter stressed the need for “the strictest” capital base for systemically important banks, yet signalled willingness to entertain “targeted, proportionate” adjustments if parliament backs the compromise. Centrist and right‑of‑centre parliamentary groups echoed this balance, warning that Swiss rules must not diverge so far from EU, UK, US and Asian standards that competitiveness erodes.

European regulators have also taken note. A senior EU banking‑supervision official, speaking to the *Financial Times*, described Switzerland’s move to bring its capital framework closer to the EU‑wide Basel‑III implementation as a “positive signal for market stability”. Aligning Swiss capital requirements with the EU’s **8 % CET1** target should reduce cross‑border frictions, allowing UBS’s European subsidiaries to remain fully capital‑adequate. The anticipated narrowing of the “regulatory arbitrage” premium could shave **0.1‑0.2 %** off financing costs for EU corporates that rely on UBS for syndicated loans and capital‑markets work.

The financial magnitude of the compromise is clear. By averting a $26 billion capital hike, UBS can redeploy the saved resources into lending, wealth‑management and technology investments, bolstering its role as a primary financier of European corporates and high‑net‑worth individuals. While parliamentary debate is not slated until **2027**, the proposal has already reshaped the government’s negotiating stance and reassured investors that the worst‑case scenario is unlikely.

In sum, the Swiss compromise offers a dual‑pronged relief – tax and capital – that could safeguard billions of francs and dollars for UBS, sustain its European footprint and contribute to a more level playing field between Swiss banks and their EU counterparts.
