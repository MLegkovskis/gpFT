**France pushes to postpone EU‑Mercosur trade pact, echoing its earlier blockade of the EU‑Canada CETA agreement** – In a bid to safeguard French agriculture, the government has asked the European Union to shift the signing deadline from December 2025 to January 2026, just days before the scheduled EU‑Mercosur summit in Brazil. The move follows a near‑unanimous resolution in the French National Assembly (244‑1) condemning the deal as “simply not acceptable” and mirrors the decisive Senate rejection of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada in March 2024.

Paris’ request, lodged on 14 December 2025, was framed as a need for “legitimate measures of protection for our European agriculture”. Prime Minister’s office spokespeople argued that the current timetable would leave French beef, poultry and sugar producers exposed to a flood of cheaper imports from the 720 million‑strong Mercosur market. Finance Minister Roland Lescure reinforced the stance, describing the treaty as “not acceptable” in an interview with *Handelsblatt*.

The French position is not new. When CETA provisionally entered force in September 2017, the French Senate voted 211‑0 against full ratification in March 2024, citing fears that Canadian livestock standards would undercut domestic producers. President Emmanuel Macron lamented the outcome as a “setback for French agriculture and industry”, while Arnaud Gaillot of the Young Farmers union warned of threats to the livestock sector. Despite a 33 % rise in French exports to Canada between 2017 and 2023 – cheese up 60 % and wine up 24 % – the Senate’s blanket rejection underscored Paris’ willingness to use parliamentary tools to halt agreements it deems harmful to its agrarian base.

Economic modelling from a European Parliament study released in June 2025 offers a sobering counterpoint to the political drama. The GTAP 11c computable general equilibrium simulation predicts a negligible impact on France’s gross domestic product – effectively 0.0 % – should the EU‑Mercosur deal be implemented as scheduled. The EU‑27 as a whole would see a modest 0.1 % long‑run boost, reflecting Mercosur’s modest share of EU trade (2.3 % of exports, 2.2 % of imports in 2024). Gains are confined to sectors such as machinery (+0.4 %), chemicals (+0.3 %) and transport equipment (+0.4 %). By contrast, French agri‑food output would experience a slight contraction, with bovine meat projected to fall by 0.4 % as imports rise.

The disparity between the macro‑economic outlook and the political fervour stems from the deal’s built‑in safeguards. Tariff‑rate quotas, sector‑specific safeguards and a €1 billion agricultural adjustment fund are designed to cushion French producers from sudden market shocks. Nonetheless, the French government’s narrative centres on environmental guarantees and the perceived “bad deal” for European agriculture, echoing Macron’s 2023 criticism that the pact lacked sufficient climate protections.

France’s strategy therefore follows a clear pattern: when confronted with large‑scale free‑trade agreements, Paris mobilises parliamentary mechanisms to either delay or block ratification, foregrounding agricultural and environmental concerns. The Mercosur episode differs only in tone – a request for postponement rather than outright rejection – but the underlying calculus remains the same: protect domestic producers and preserve political capital among rural constituencies.

With the EU‑Mercosur summit looming on 20 December 2025 in Brazil, the outcome of France’s push will shape the broader European timetable. If the EU accedes to the January 2026 deadline, the deal may proceed with additional concessions; a refusal could reignite farmer protests and force a renegotiation of key safeguards. In either case, the French stance reaffirms its role as a decisive gatekeeper of Europe’s trade agenda, especially where agriculture and environmental standards intersect.
