**France’s request to push the EU‑Mercosur signing to early 2025 has thrown the long‑awaited free‑trade pact into political limbo, prompting a clash between Paris’s agricultural safeguards and Brussels’s economic optimism.**  

The French government formally asked the European Union to postpone the scheduled **20 December 2024** signing ceremony and the accompanying Council vote, proposing a new timetable “early 2025” – January at the earliest – on the grounds that “core conditions” on mirrored clauses, sanitary controls and agricultural safeguards remain unmet【devdiscourse】. The move, announced in early December, revives Paris’s long‑standing scepticism about opening its markets to South American farm produce, a sector that accounts for roughly **20 %** of EU agricultural imports at risk without adequate protections【Reuters】.

Across the EU, leaders have defended the agreement as a historic commercial win. European Commission President **Ursula von der Leyen** described it as a “win‑win” that delivers “meaningful benefits to consumers and businesses” and highlighted the “robust safeguards” added after listening to farmers【Reuters】. European Council President **Antonio Costa** called the pact “very important” and urged Member States to evaluate it, while German Chancellor **Olaf Scholz** stressed that the deal would create a free market for more than **700 million people** after two decades of negotiations【Reuters】. Spanish Prime Minister **Pedro Sánchez** pledged to secure Council approval, framing the agreement as a boost to “prosperity and resilience”【Reuters】.

From the Mercosur side, Brazilian President **Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva** welcomed the “modern and balanced” text, noting its alignment with the Paris climate agreement and its potential to open new markets for Brazilian exports【Reuters】. Argentine President **Javier Milei**, Paraguayan President **Santiago Pena**, and Uruguayan President **Luis Lacalle Pou** echoed the sentiment, calling the pact a historic opportunity for the region’s investment climate【Reuters】.

Quantitatively, the EU‑Mercosur partnership would link **≈ 780 million consumers** (EU ≈ 447 m + Mercosur ≈ 333 m) and could lift bilateral trade by **up to 15 %** over the next decade, according to a 2024 European Commission impact study【Reuters】. The agreement still requires a qualified‑majority in the European Council and a majority vote in the European Parliament, the latter slated for mid‑December before France’s postponement request【Reuters】.

While the precise effect on France’s GDP and trade balance remains unquantified in the available data, the projected 15 % trade uplift suggests a material, albeit contested, benefit for French exporters and consumers. Paris’s insistence on stricter agricultural clauses reflects a broader protective stance that could temper the overall gains, especially if the “mirror‑clause” safeguards are not incorporated.

The standoff underscores a fundamental tension within the EU: reconciling the desire for a unified, expansive market with the need to safeguard domestic sectors. As the European Council deliberates, the outcome will determine whether the EU‑Mercosur free‑trade zone, a project spanning **25 years**, finally materialises or stalls under national objections.
