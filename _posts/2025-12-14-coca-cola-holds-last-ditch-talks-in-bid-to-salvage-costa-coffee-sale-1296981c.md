**Coca‑Cola holds last‑ditch talks in bid to salvage Costa Coffee sale**

Coca‑Cola is scrambling to keep its planned divestment of Costa Coffee alive after price disagreements with private‑equity firm TDR Capital threatened to derail the deal. The company, which bought the coffee chain for **£3.9 bn** in January 2019, now faces a potential **£1.9 bn** write‑down if the sale proceeds at the rumored **£2 bn** level – a loss of roughly **48 %** of the original investment【PE Insights】. Analysts warn that a collapse would cement a strategic mis‑fit, weigh on earnings and dent the stock, which fell **1.2 %** in the week after the latest report【RTT News】.

The “last‑ditch talks” reported by RTT News describe Coca‑Cola’s attempt to retain a minority stake in Costa as a fallback, preserving upside while shedding the heavy retail burden【RTT News】. The move reflects a broader consensus among market commentators that the high‑street coffee business sits uneasily alongside Coca‑Cola’s core concentrate‑and‑bottling model. **Bernstein** downgraded the stock to *underweight*, citing the “strategic mis‑fit and earnings drag” of retaining Costa【Bernstein】. **Verdict Food Service** adds that the chain’s capital‑intensive footprint – estimated at **£500 m** of working capital and **£300 m** of lease obligations – could be redeployed to higher‑margin ready‑to‑drink (RTD) coffee and vending‑machine ventures, which deliver **15‑20 %** higher contribution margins【Verdict Food Service】.

The financial picture of Costa has deteriorated since the acquisition. **Food Navigator** notes a **£9.6 m pre‑tax loss** in 2022 and an EBITDA margin of **‑2.3 %**, far short of the **8 %** target set in 2019【Food Navigator】. The pandemic amplified structural weaknesses, with store closures, rent hikes and a shift to at‑home coffee eroding foot‑traffic. Credit Suisse’s valuation model, which placed Costa at **£2.5 bn** based on a **10× 2019E EBITDA** multiple, shows that the current disposal price of **£3.8 bn** (after transaction costs) would imply a **15.7×** multiple – effectively locking in a loss of **£2.0 bn** above the market price at the time of purchase【Credit Suisse】.

If the sale collapses, the immediate impact would be two‑fold. First, the balance sheet would absorb a near‑£2 bn loss, pressuring Coca‑Cola’s earnings guidance and likely shaving **0.3–0.5** points off its price‑to‑earnings multiple, according to consensus estimates【Bernstein】. Second, the company would remain saddled with a non‑core, under‑performing asset, diverting management attention from its more profitable segments such as RTD coffee, vending, and bottler partnerships.

The most plausible outcome, as suggested by industry observers, is a partial exit: Coca‑Cola would relinquish the high‑street retail operation while retaining a minority interest that keeps the brand within its portfolio without the operational drag【RTT News】. Such a structure would allow the group to reap any future upside from Costa’s brand equity while freeing capital for growth areas that align with its core competencies.

In short, the stakes are high. A failed sale would cement a costly strategic error, erode shareholder value and leave Coca‑Cola with a lingering retail liability. The ongoing negotiations will determine whether the company can finally extricate itself from the Costa conundrum and refocus on its traditional beverage strengths.
