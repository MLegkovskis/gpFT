**Coca‑Cola is engaged in “last‑ditch” negotiations to rescue a stalled sale of Costa Coffee, seeking to secure a price around £1.5 bn before the deal collapses into a forced write‑off. The talks, reported in December 2025, follow an earlier round of bids that fell short of the beverage giant’s expectations and have raised fresh concerns about the viability of the coffee chain within Coca‑Cola’s portfolio.**

The current effort mirrors a pattern that began in August 2025 when Coca‑Cola hired Lazard to explore strategic options for Costa, signalling the first public move to divest the asset. At that time the market was already pricing the chain at roughly half the £3.9 bn paid for the 2019 acquisition, a compression of about 62 % that analysts described as a “steep discount”. By September 2025, senior Lazard sources told Food Navigator that the company was trying to lift the price to the mid‑£1.5 bn range, a figure still well below the original purchase price but deemed necessary to avoid a full write‑off.

The underlying economics have deteriorated sharply. Costa’s EBITDA margin slipped from 9 % in 2022 to 4 % in 2024 as inflation‑driven labour and rent costs eroded profitability. FY 2023 revenue fell to £1.22 bn, and the chain posted a pre‑tax loss of £9.6 m, underscoring the operational challenges of running a capital‑intensive café network under an asset‑light beverage group. These trends have made the chain less attractive to potential buyers and heightened the urgency of the current negotiations.

Strategically, the divestiture is the most visible element of Coca‑Cola’s “Refresh 2025” plan, which aims to grow high‑margin, non‑carbonated categories by 5 % of total revenue by 2027. Retaining Costa at a steep book‑value loss would divert capital from faster‑growing segments such as coffee capsules and ready‑to‑drink tea, forcing a re‑evaluation of the company’s broader diversification agenda. CEO James Quincey has repeatedly stressed the need to protect shareholder value while acknowledging a “structural mismatch” between the service‑heavy café model and Coca‑Cola’s core competencies in global distribution and brand licensing.

Analysts view the stalled sale as a validation of the wider “portfolio‑simplification” wave sweeping the consumer‑goods sector. Nandini Roy Choudhury of Future Market Insights noted that the failure of a high‑profile cross‑category acquisition would likely dampen enthusiasm for similar mega‑deals, reinforcing the notion that brand size alone does not guarantee success in the out‑of‑home coffee market. Dominic Paul, former CEO of Costa, warned that a collapse would highlight the difficulty of scaling a coffee chain under a soft‑drink conglomerate and could temper investor appetite for future cross‑category transactions.

Market reaction to the latest development has been muted. LSEG analyst consensus recorded a modest 0.4 % dip in Coca‑Cola’s share price on news of the “last‑ditch” talks, reflecting Costa’s contribution of less than 0.5 % to total group revenue in FY 2024. Nonetheless, the strategic signal is significant: a failed sale would cement the view that the coffee‑shop business is fundamentally misaligned with Coca‑Cola’s asset‑light model, while a successful deal—even at a reduced valuation—could free the company to focus on higher‑margin, scalable categories.

In summary, the current negotiations are a high‑pressure attempt to extract the maximum value from a heavily de‑valued asset before a forced sale or full write‑off becomes inevitable. The episode underscores three key lessons for the industry: valuation compression is inevitable when a service‑heavy brand is paired with an asset‑light group; early strategic reviews are essential to preserve value; and selective retention of high‑margin sub‑assets, such as Costa’s ready‑to‑drink coffee portfolio, may be the most pragmatic path forward.
