### Tether Retreats from $20bn Funding Ambitions
Tether, a major player in the cryptocurrency sector, has scaled back its funding ambitions from $20bn to $5-$10bn due to investor pushback. The pushback was primarily driven by skepticism over Tether's $500bn valuation and persistent doubts about the firm's reserve transparency and regulatory exposure.

The company's initial funding target was met with reluctance from potential backers, who questioned the valuation and expressed concerns over the firm's track record of fines and limited audit clarity. As a result, Tether's advisers trimmed the fundraising ceiling to as low as $5bn, and the company publicly downplayed its original $20bn ambition.

The revised funding target reflects a significant adjustment in Tether's growth plans and may impact its stock moves and overall market position in the cryptocurrency sector. The company's ability to secure funding at a lower valuation may also have implications for its revenue and GDP impact.
