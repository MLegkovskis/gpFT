Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on US President Trump to take a strong stance against Russia, citing the need for a decisive sanctions package and increased military aid to Ukraine. In a series of interviews, Zelenskyy accused Russia of 'playing games' and warned that they will not stop their aggression without firm action from the US and other countries. The Ukrainian president urged Trump to impose a strong sanctions package, apply pressure on sectors that finance the Kremlin, provide more 'hard' military aid, and take a clear public stance against Putin. Zelenskyy also called for a cease-fire to enable a Ukrainian-run referendum and highlighted the need for the US to support this step. The situation remains tense, with recent Russian strikes killing 35 and injuring 117 in Sumy, and Ukrainian forces recapturing 400 sq km of territory in Dnipropetrovsk. Zelenskyy's demands come on the fourth anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and he warned that without a firm US stance, 'the Russians will keep playing games'.
