The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has been embroiled in controversy following the release of documents by the US Department of Justice, which revealed a link between the foundation and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The foundation's chief has acknowledged that the connection has 'sullied' its reputation. 
   
   The relationship between the foundation and Epstein began in 2011, when a senior adviser to Bill Gates introduced Epstein to a director of the foundation's Global Health donor-advised fund and to the foundation's CFO. Over the next few years, there were several in-person meetings and dinners between Bill Gates and Epstein, despite Epstein's conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. 
   
   The foundation has repeatedly denied any financial payments or employment of Epstein, and has stated that it regrets having any employees interact with him. The foundation's statement emphasized that 'no financial payments were ever made' to Epstein and that 'no fund was ever created' in collaboration with him. 
   
   The foundation's chief has expressed regret over the connection, stating that the foundation 'regrets having any employees interact with Epstein in any way.' Bill Gates has also publicly acknowledged that his contact with Epstein was a 'huge mistake' and that he 'regrets every minute' of it. 
   
   While the foundation has taken steps to distance itself from Epstein, the controversy has raised questions about the foundation's judgment and its ability to prevent similar associations in the future. However, due to research limitations, the specific measures the foundation will take to address the reputational damage and ensure transparency were not available.
