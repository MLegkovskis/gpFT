**How Warner Bros Discovery’s David Zaslav defied Hollywood — again**

David Zaslav’s latest manoeuvre – the decision to split Warner Bros. Discovery into two independently listed companies – has sent the market soaring and reignited a debate that has followed him since the 2022 merger. The split, announced on 9 June 2025, promises a Warner Bros. entity focused on studio and streaming with an expected FY 2026 revenue of $30 billion, and a Discovery Global arm centred on cable and non‑scripted content targeting $12 billion. Within days the share price jumped 12 per cent, lifting the market capitalisation from $45 billion to $50 billion and taking the stock from $18.15 in April 2022 to $29.98 by mid‑December 2025 – a rise of roughly 65 per cent since the merger created the WBD ticker.

The split is the latest illustration of Zaslav’s willingness to rewrite the Hollywood playbook. In 2023 he walked away from a $2.6 billion NBA rights deal and shelved the tentpole *Batgirl* film, writing off $70 million rather than incur a loss. Those moves, condemned by talent unions and some creatives, were praised by Wall Street for protecting the balance sheet. Morgan Stanley’s media team called the split “the most credible path to unlock value” after years of under‑performance, while Goldman Sachs analyst Maya Miller highlighted the $1.2 billion operating profit recorded in Q4 2023 as proof that Zaslav’s “laser‑focus on cost discipline and selective theatrical releases” was finally paying off.

Zaslav’s strategy is built on a blend of data‑driven pragmatism and strategic flexibility. Ben Thompson of Stratechery observed early in the integration that Zaslav treats streaming “as an addition to the old model, not a wholesale replacement.” That philosophy underpinned the launch of the combined Max platform in February 2023, which quickly amassed 73 million global subscribers by the end of 2023. Yet he has not shied away from re‑emphasising theatrical windows. Steven Spilker, president of the Motion Picture Association, praised the “theatrical‑first stance” as a “welcome corrective” after years of streaming‑only releases, while a SAG‑AFTRA representative complained that Zaslav “doesn’t understand residuals,” reflecting lingering tension with talent unions.

Industry insiders see Zaslav as both visionary and polarising. Andy Lack, former NBC News head and longtime friend, told New York Magazine in 2025 that “we won’t recognise the industry in five years – and David is the one trying to ‘future‑proof’ it.” By contrast, Variety’s Brian Lowry described his leadership as “endless vacillation,” noting that Zaslav swings between “HBO‑Max‑first” and “theatrical‑first” strategies but that “strategic flexibility” is exactly what the market demands. Even competitors acknowledge his analytical bent; an off‑record Netflix senior VP called him “the most data‑driven studio chief we’ve ever dealt with.”

Financial discipline has been the backbone of Zaslav’s tenure. In October 2022 the newly merged entity posted a $2.6 billion loss on a $15.6 billion debt load, with a debt‑to‑EBITDA ratio of roughly 5.5×. By March 2024, after a series of cost‑cutting programmes that trimmed operating expenses by 15 per cent year‑on‑year, the debt multiple had fallen to about 3.2× and the company recorded its first operating profit since the merger. Dan Ives of Wedbush highlighted that Zaslav inherited a massive balance sheet and has forced a shift from “big‑ticket content” to cash‑flow generation.

The split also signals a decisive move away from the sprawling conglomerate model that defined the 2022 merger. Gunnar Wiedenfels, CFO‑turned‑CEO of the forthcoming Discovery Global, praised the plan as creating “two focused growth engines – a move only a true outsider like Zaslav could envision.” Analysts agree that the separation will allow each brand to pursue distinct strategic priorities, with Warner Bros. free to double‑down on premium scripted and franchise filmmaking, while Discovery Global can double‑down on its strong unscripted and international cable portfolio.

Zaslav’s journey from the cable‑centric world of Discovery, where he championed aggressive expansion and the launch of Discovery+ in 2020, to the complex, debt‑laden universe of Warner Bros. Discovery illustrates a shift from growth‑focused acquisitions to integration, cost control and portfolio rationalisation. The result is a leader who repeatedly defies Hollywood conventions – cutting a $70 million film, rejecting a $2.6 billion sports deal, and now dismantling the very conglomerate he helped create – all while earning the admiration of investors and the ire of some creative quarters.
