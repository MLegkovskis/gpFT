### US and UK Withdraw Diplomats from Middle East Amid Rising War Fears with Iran
The United States and the United Kingdom have withdrawn their diplomats from the Middle East due to rising war fears with Iran. This move comes as tensions between the three nations continue to escalate.

### Diplomatic Efforts to De-escalate the Situation
Despite the rising tensions, the European Union, the United Nations, and other international parties are making diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation. These efforts include the re-imposition and coordinated enforcement of UN Security Council sanctions, EU diplomatic outreach and terrorist-list designation, regional mediation, and confidence-building programs.

### Key Diplomatic Initiatives
Some key diplomatic initiatives include:
* The EU's designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization and its call for maximum restraint.
* The UN Security Council's adoption of a snap-back resolution re-imposing all nuclear-related sanctions on Iran.
* Qatar's hosting of a Gulf-wide diplomatic round with Iran, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, and the US envoy, which produced a Joint Declaration of De-escalation.
* Oman's mediation of indirect US-Iran talks, which focused on nuclear verification and a limited step-by-step sanctions relief.
* The EU-UAE Joint Initiative's launch of a Middle-East Confidence-Building Programme, which aims to create a transparent security environment and reduce the risk of accidental escalation.
