### Trump's Policies Dent International Travel to US in Blow to Tourism Sector
The Trump administration's policies have been cited as the primary cause for the decline in international travel to the United States. The re-instated travel ban, tightened visa-approval rules, mass immigration raids, proposed ESTA-social-media screening, tariffs on long-standing allies, and detention of foreign tourists at the border have all contributed to a significant drop in international arrivals.

The travel ban, which blocks entry for nationals of 19 countries and tightens family-reunification rules for refugees, has been particularly damaging. The tightened visa-approval rules have also reduced the number of visas issued under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). Additionally, the mass immigration raids and increased border enforcement have generated negative media coverage, amplifying the perception of the US as a 'hostile state' for visitors.

The proposed ESTA-social-media screening, which requires travelers from VWP countries to submit social-media handles for automated risk assessment before ESTA approval, has created uncertainty among potential travelers. A poll of 2,300 VWP citizens showed that 57% would postpone travel until the rule is clarified.

The tariffs on long-standing allies, including the EU, Canada, and Japan, have also contributed to an unfavorable perception of the US among international travelers. The detention of foreign tourists at the border has further eroded confidence among international tourists.

The quantified impact on tourism is significant, with an 8.2% decline in international arrivals projected for 2025. The visitor spending is expected to be $169 billion in 2025, down from $181 billion in 2024. The economic loss attributed to Trump policies is estimated to be $29 billion in lost tourism revenue.
