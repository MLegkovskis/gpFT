**The Wolf‑Krugman Exchange: America vs the World – A Snapshot of 2025 Growth Divergence**  

The United States has posted a **3.8 % annualised surge in Q2 2025**, outpacing every major peer and reviving a debate that pits American economic resilience against the rising momentum of China, India and the rest of the globe (U.S. BEA)【1】. Yet the optimism is tempered by a volatile forecast that swings between **1.2 % and 2.0 %** for the full year, underscoring the fragility of the rebound (World Bank)【3】.  

The latest quarterly data, confirmed by Trading Economics, shows the U.S. economy expanding at a pace not seen since the post‑pandemic boom, driven by AI‑related investment, lower rates and modest fiscal support (World Bank)【3】. By contrast, the euro‑area is expected to grow a modest **1.3 %** in 2025 (OECD)【6】, while Germany and Japan linger at **1.4 %** and **1.2 %** respectively (OECD; Reuters)【6】【7】. The United Kingdom, still wrestling with post‑Brexit adjustments, is forecast at a tepid **0.8 %** (IMF)【8】.  

China remains the only advanced economy to outpace the United States in growth, with a projected **≈ 5 %** real‑GDP increase (Focus Economics)【5】, but its nominal GDP of **$19.4 trillion** still trails the U.S. **$30.62 trillion** base (Worldometer)【10】. India’s explosive **6.7 %** forecast (World Bank)【9】 signals a rapid catch‑up, yet its nominal output of roughly **$3.5 trillion** is a fraction of America’s size, limiting its immediate impact on global totals.  

The divergent trajectories feed the “Wolf‑Krugman” narrative: Paul Krugman’s cautionary view of a slowing American engine versus the more bullish “Wolf” stance that highlights the United States’ capacity to generate growth from a vastly larger economic platform. The Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, which pegs 2025 growth at **1.9 %**, reflects a consensus that the U.S. will settle near the lower end of the range, still above most peers but far from the dynamism of emerging markets (Philadelphia Fed)【4】.  

Short‑run momentum, however, may be fleeting. The World Bank notes that the U.S. swing in expectations—from **2.2 %** in January to **1.2 %** in May before rebounding—mirrors policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs, fiscal stance and monetary tightening (World Bank)【3】. If the AI‑driven surge proves durable, the United States could add a sizeable slice to global output, reinforcing its claim to economic exceptionalism. Conversely, a slowdown would vindicate critics who argue that the U.S. advantage is increasingly a function of its sheer nominal base rather than superior growth performance.  

In sum, the 2025 data paint a picture of an American economy that, while still the world’s largest by nominal GDP, is navigating a narrow growth corridor between the modest recovery of its European neighbours and the brisk expansion of Asian rivals. The Wolf‑Krugman exchange will continue to hinge on whether the United States can translate its quarterly burst into a sustained annual trajectory.
