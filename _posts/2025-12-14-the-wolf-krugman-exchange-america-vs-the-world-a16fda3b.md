**The United States is posting the strongest year‑over‑year growth among the G7, yet its quarterly momentum still trails the surge in emerging markets, while a new wave of protectionism threatens to erode that advantage.** 

Real GDP expanded at an annualised 3.8 % in the second quarter of 2025, the fastest quarterly pace among the traditional industrialised bloc. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow now‑cast puts the third‑quarter outlook at 3.6 % annualised, and the full‑year estimate from Trading Economics settles at a modest 2.02 % increase. By contrast, China is forecast to grow 4.8 % and India 6.6 % in 2025, according to IMF‑derived World Economic Outlook figures. The BRICS bloc as a whole is expected to expand by 3.8 %, outpacing the G7 average of 1.2 %. Within the G7, the eurozone’s Q3 growth was a tepid 0.2 % quarter‑over‑quarter, the United Kingdom barely 0.1 %, Germany flat, France 0.5 % and Japan in contraction at –0.4 %. 

The United States’ relative dynamism is therefore confined to a narrow set of metrics. Its annual growth outstrips every other G7 member, but it lags behind the emerging‑market powerhouses that now dominate the global growth engine. The disparity is reflected in trade flows: the United States has imposed a series of tariffs that echo the sweeping protectionism of the 1930s Smoot‑Hawley Tariff Act. The 2020‑25 tariff regime began with the Trump administration’s 25 % duty on $370 bn of Chinese imports, followed by a 10 % levy on $200 bn of EU goods and a 7.5 % surcharge on Canadian and Mexican products under the USMCA. 

The historical parallel is stark. Smoot‑Hawley raised duties on roughly 20 000 items by an average of 20 %, prompting retaliatory tariffs that slashed US‑European trade by two‑thirds and contributed to a 65 % collapse in global trade over the next five years. Today, China has responded with 25 % counter‑tariffs on US soybeans and automobiles, while the EU has launched anti‑subsidy investigations into US aircraft. The World Bank, cited by FiscalNote, warns that such measures could shave 0.5 % off global GDP growth and trim international trade volumes by 2.1 %. 

Both eras share five core themes. First, the breadth of the tariff hikes—thousands of product lines then, hundreds of billions of dollars now—signals a systematic shift rather than a targeted response. Second, the retaliatory spiral has already begun to dent bilateral trade growth, mirroring the post‑Smoot‑Hawley collapse. Third, higher import duties translate into higher retail prices for consumers, a pressure point that resurfaces in contemporary policy debates. Fourth, political rhetoric frames protection as a defence of national security and domestic industry, echoing the 1930s narrative of safeguarding farmers and businesses. Finally, each episode leaves a lasting legacy: Smoot‑Hawley spurred the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, while today’s “free‑trade protectionism” is prompting allies to negotiate new FTAs that hedge against US‑driven barriers. 

For policymakers in Brussels, Beijing and Washington, the message is clear. Europe’s modest Q3 growth underscores the fragility of its export‑driven economies, prompting Brussels to seek multilateral safeguards against unilateral US tariffs. Beijing, confronting a steep trade imbalance—$538.5 bn of imports versus $20.3 bn of exports to the United States—has leveraged counter‑tariffs to extract concessions. Washington, meanwhile, balances the political appeal of “Liberation Day” tariffs with the risk that a prolonged trade war could erode the United States’ competitive edge, even as its GDP outpaces fellow G7 members. 

In sum, the United States enjoys a fleeting lead within the G7, but the resurgence of protectionist policy threatens to undermine that advantage and accelerate the shift of growth momentum toward the emerging economies that are now steering the world’s economic engine.
