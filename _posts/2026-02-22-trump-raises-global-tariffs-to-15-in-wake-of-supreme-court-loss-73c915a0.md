# Trump Raises Global Tariffs to 15% After Supreme Court Loss
The Trump administration has faced a significant setback after the Supreme Court struck down its global tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The Court ruled that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs, forcing the administration to pivot its trade policy approach.
## Immediate Implications
The Supreme Court's decision has immediate implications for the Trump administration and its policies. The administration must now rely on Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, Section 301 (unfair-trade investigations), and Section 232 (national-security tariffs) for any further import duties. The new tariffs announced under Section 122 have a 150-day limit, after which Congress must act to extend or terminate them.
## Revenue and Refund Implications
The ruling puts approximately $160 billion of collected tariff revenue in legal limbo, with up to $133 billion potentially subject to refund claims. This could lead to a multi-year litigation pipeline and significant revenue loss for the administration.
## Political Fallout
The loss removes a major source of budget revenue and weakens the administration's leverage in trade negotiations ahead of the 2026 mid-term elections. Trump has called the ruling a 'disgrace' and blasted the justices as 'fools and lap-dogs', fueling criticism of his 'overreach' and energizing opponents in the upcoming midterms.
## Conclusion
The Supreme Court's decision and the subsequent tariff increase mark a significant shift in the administration's trade policy approach. The outcome may have far-reaching implications for the US economy, international trade relationships, and the administration's political standing.
