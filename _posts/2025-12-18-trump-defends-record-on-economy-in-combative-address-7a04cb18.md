# Trump defends record on economy in combative address 

**In a televised speech on 16 December 2025, President Donald Trump claimed that his administration had “fixed the damage caused by Joe Biden” and delivered a “record‑time, America‑First economy”, pointing to a private‑sector jobs surge and a 3 % inflation rate as proof of success. The address, however, arrived amid a modest rise in unemployment to 4.6 % and a slowdown in job creation that lags behind the performance of his two immediate predecessors.** 

Trump’s figures for his second term – which began on 20 January 2025 – show roughly 687,000 net private‑sector jobs added, with a notable monthly gain of 121 000 in September and 225 000 in August. By contrast, the Biden administration added about two million jobs over four years, averaging 186 000 per month in 2024, while the Obama era produced an estimated 11.6 million jobs across eight years. The pace under Trump, therefore, is markedly slower than the growth seen in the prior administrations. 

The president also highlighted that all of his net job growth has occurred in the private sector, while federal employment fell by about 168 000 since he took office. Biden’s tenure recorded a similar decline in federal jobs of roughly 100 000, but his overall job gains were a blend of private‑ and public‑sector hires, including health‑care and education. The shift in composition is a central theme of Trump’s narrative, positioning private‑sector expansion as a vindication of his “America‑First” policies. 

Unemployment, however, tells a less flattering story. The latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data for November 2025 placed the rate at 4.6 %, the highest level in more than four years. This is a rise from the 3.7 % low recorded in October 2024 under Biden and marginally above the 4.7 % level at the close of Obama’s second term. The increase suggests a weakening labour market despite the president’s upbeat rhetoric. 

Inflation remains another point of contention. Consumer‑price index figures show a 3 % annual rise in September 2025, leaving a one‑percentage‑point gap above the Federal Reserve’s 2 % target. Biden’s final year in office saw inflation at 2.4 %, while Obama’s average across his two terms was 1.8 %. The Bush administration’s average was 2.5 % with a peak of 4 % in 2008. Although Trump’s 3 % is well below historic spikes of 23.7 % in 1919‑1920 and 14.8 % in 1979‑1980, it still exceeds the target that the Fed pursued under his two immediate predecessors. 

Real‑wage growth is another claim in Trump’s address, with the White House asserting a 4.2 % increase in the first full year of his term, “far outpacing inflation”. Independent fact‑checkers note that wage gains have been uneven, favouring workers with college degrees and sectors such as health‑care and education, while manufacturing‑oriented wages have lagged. 

Overall, the data paint a mixed picture. Job creation under Trump’s current term is modest and slower than under Biden, and the unemployment rate has edged upward. Inflation, while far removed from the early‑20th‑century extremes, remains above the Fed’s comfort zone, a contrast to the lower rates achieved during the Obama years. The president’s combative defence of his economic record therefore rests on selective metrics that obscure broader trends.
