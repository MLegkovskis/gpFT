### Market Rally After Trump's Greenland Deal Announcement
The US stock markets have shown a significant rally after President Trump's announcement of a framework deal with Greenland at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged over 700 points, or 1.5%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also climbed around 1.5%. The Russell 2000, which tracks small-cap stocks, jumped nearly 2% to an all-time high. The KBW Bank Index also rose more than 2% in midday trading.

The market reaction was a direct response to Trump's announcement, which included the decision not to impose threatened tariffs on European nations. This move erased the steep losses recorded on the previous day when Trump had threatened tariffs on eight European countries.

### Key Points
* The rally was most pronounced in US equity markets, with no comparable move seen in foreign-exchange or European-index data.
* Small-cap stocks outperformed large-cap, with the Russell 2000's gain exceeding the moves in the three major indices.
* The Dow Jones posted the largest absolute point gain, while the Russell 2000 delivered the highest percentage gain.
