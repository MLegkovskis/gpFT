**Warner Bros. Discovery is poised to reject Paramount Skydance’s amended $108.4 billion all‑cash takeover offer, a move that underscores the resilience of the media giant despite a modest share‑price dip of 0.03 per cent to $28.94 in the last 24 hours.** 

The hostile bid, first unveiled on 8 December 2025 at $30 per share, was subsequently strengthened with a $5.8 billion breakup fee and a personal guarantee from Oracle founder Larry Ellison. The amendment lifted the total valuation to $108.4 billion, a figure that would rank among the largest ever attempted in the entertainment sector. Yet, as market data from 31 December 2025 shows, Warner Bros. Discovery’s stock has barely budged, slipping marginally to $28.94 on the NASDAQ, a decline of just three‑hundredths of a percent over the previous day.

Analysts interpret the tepid market reaction as a signal that investors remain unconvinced of the bid’s strategic merit. The price per share offered sits below the current trading level, suggesting that the premium demanded by Paramount Skydance may be insufficient to sway shareholders who are wary of the debt‑laden structure implied by the sizeable breakup fee. Moreover, the personal guarantee from Ellison, while notable, does not appear to have altered market sentiment, which continues to price the stock close to its pre‑bid level.

Warner Bros. Discovery’s leadership is expected to formally decline the proposal, a stance that aligns with the company’s recent emphasis on organic growth and strategic partnerships rather than a full‑scale merger. The decision, if confirmed, would place the media conglomerate among a small cohort of firms that have resisted high‑profile takeover attempts in recent years, preserving its autonomy in an industry increasingly defined by consolidation. By rejecting the offer, Warner Bros. Discovery retains control over its expansive portfolio of film, television, and streaming assets, and can continue to pursue its own acquisition agenda without the constraints of a hostile takeover.

The broader implications for the media landscape are significant. Paramount Skydance’s aggressive pursuit reflects a belief that scale is essential to compete with streaming behemoths and to secure bargaining power with advertisers and content creators. A rejection by Warner Bros. Discovery could prompt Paramount to recalibrate its strategy, perhaps seeking alternative targets or revisiting the terms of its offer. The episode also highlights the delicate balance between shareholder value and strategic fit that boards must navigate when confronted with unsolicited bids of this magnitude.

In the short term, the market is likely to remain steady, with Warner Bros. Discovery’s share price expected to track closely to its current level pending any further developments. Investors will watch closely for any official statements from the companies involved, which could provide additional insight into the strategic calculus behind the rejection and the next steps for both parties.
