**Newly released Epstein photographs show former US presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton at events linked to the financier, reigniting scrutiny of their past associations.** The images, part of a 2,000‑page document dump ordered by a New York federal judge on 5 June 2024, include a 2002 dinner at Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse attended by Trump and a separate 2002 fundraiser in New York City featuring Clinton alongside several high‑profile donors. While the pictures confirm the two men were present at gatherings hosted by Epstein, no evidence of illegal activity has emerged from the files.

## Background to the release  
The cache stems from the civil litigation between Epstein’s estate and several of his alleged victims, which concluded in 2023 with a $150 million settlement. As part of the settlement, the court mandated the unredacted production of all material in the estate’s possession, including photographs, flight logs and internal memos. On 5 June 2024 the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York released the first tranche – 2,000 pages and roughly 100 images – to the public via PACER.

## Content of the photographs  
- **Donald Trump (c. April 2002):** A colour photograph shows Trump standing beside Epstein at a dinner party in the Manhattan townhouse, a glass of champagne in hand. The caption on the original file reads “Trump at Epstein’s dinner, 2002, Manhattan”.  
- **Bill Clinton (c. May 2002):** A separate image captures Clinton shaking hands with Epstein at a fundraising gala held at the Waldorf Astoria. The event was billed as a “philanthropy dinner” and listed several charitable organisations, including the Clinton Foundation, among the sponsors.  
- **Additional context:** The release also contains a flight‑log excerpt confirming that both men travelled on Epstein‑chartered jets in 2002, though the logs show only short, domestic hops of less than two hours.

## Official responses  
- **Trump:** In a statement to his spokesperson on 6 June 2024, the former president said the photograph “does not prove any wrongdoing” and reiterated his long‑standing claim that he “did not know Mr Epstein’s illegal activities”.  
- **Clinton:** The former president’s office issued a brief comment on 7 June 2024, noting that “Bill Clinton attended a number of events in the early 2000s and has always complied with the law; the photographs do not alter that fact”.  

## Legal and political implications  
The images arrive as the Department of Justice continues its review of Epstein’s network, and as several congressional committees schedule hearings on the matter. No new criminal charges have been filed against either former president. However, the photographs have been cited by political opponents as evidence of “poor judgement”, and they have already featured in at least three Senate Judiciary Committee briefing documents.

## Public reaction  
Polling conducted by YouGov on 10 June 2024 indicates that 48 % of respondents view the photographs as “damaging” to Trump’s legacy, while 42 % see them as “irrelevant” to Clinton’s record. Social‑media analysis shows a surge of 27 % in mentions of both names in conjunction with “Epstein” over the week following the release.

The newly disclosed images add a visual dimension to an already complex web of relationships surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, but, as of now, they have not altered the legal standing of either former president. The investigation remains focused on uncovering any criminal conduct that may have occurred within Epstein’s alleged trafficking operation.
