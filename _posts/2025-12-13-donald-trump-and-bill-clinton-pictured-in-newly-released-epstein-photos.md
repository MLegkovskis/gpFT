**Newly released photographs from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate show former US President Bill Clinton standing beside Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, and former President Donald Trump appearing in three separate images with women at social gatherings; the pictures were disclosed by the US House Oversight Committee on 12 December 2025 as part of a limited tranche of a 95 000‑photo cache seized from Epstein’s property.**  

## Scope of the release  
The Democratic‑led committee announced that it had obtained roughly 95 000 images from Epstein’s personal collection and, to date, has made public 19 photographs that feature high‑profile individuals. Three of the images depict Donald Trump – one at a 1997 Victoria’s Secret runway event in New York, another at a luau‑style gathering where he is surrounded by women in Hawaiian‑style leis, and a third showing him chatting with a woman while Epstein stands in the background. A single, undated picture shows Bill Clinton flanked by Epstein and Maxwell; the photograph bears Clinton’s signature at the top, suggesting it was a personal memento.  

## Context and chronology  
Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex‑offender, died by suicide in a Manhattan jail on 10 August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex‑trafficking charges. His death prompted a congressional inquiry that has, since early 2024, been reviewing the so‑called “Epstein files” – emails, flight logs and, now, visual material. The latest batch arrives ahead of a Justice Department deadline on 19 December 2025 to hand over any remaining Epstein‑related records to Congress.  

## Reactions from the figures involved  
President Donald Trump, who has previously described Epstein as a “creep” and said their friendship ended in the early 2000s, told reporters he has not seen the newly released images and denied any wrongdoing. Bill Clinton, who has long maintained that he “knows nothing about the terrible crimes” Epstein pleaded guilty to, reiterated that the photograph is a personal souvenir and that he has no knowledge of illicit activity. Both men have faced renewed calls from advocacy groups for full transparency regarding any interactions with Epstein.  

## Investigative implications  
While the photographs do not, in themselves, constitute evidence of criminal conduct, they expand the visual record of Epstein’s social network and may prompt further subpoenas for contextual information such as dates, locations and accompanying attendees. Legal analysts note that the House Oversight Committee’s incremental release strategy – 19 images now, with more expected “in the days and weeks ahead” – is designed to balance public interest with the privacy of surviving victims.  

## Outlook  
The Epstein investigation remains active, with prosecutors continuing to examine the extent of the financier’s alleged trafficking operation. As additional images and documents emerge, scrutiny of the relationships between Epstein and prominent political figures is likely to intensify, reinforcing calls for a comprehensive, bipartisan review of the case.
