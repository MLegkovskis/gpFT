**The Bank of Japan’s Kazuo Ueda declared on 23 March that Japan’s economy has “weathered” the legacy of former President Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs, a view bolstered by a modest 3.2 % year‑on‑year rise in export growth for FY 2024‑25 – the first positive swing since FY 2022. The statement marks a stark reversal from the 2018‑19 trade‑war shock, when exports fell 2.5 % overall and 9 % to China, the trade deficit peaked at ¥2.5 trillion and the yen slumped 5 % against the dollar. Today the deficit has halved to ¥1.2 trillion, the yen has weakened only 2 %, and the economy is projected to expand by about 1.5 % annualised in FY 2025. Yet policymakers and some senior officials caution that the underlying tariff regime remains unchanged and that technology‑export controls now pose a new, albeit narrower, risk. 

Export performance provides the clearest illustration of the turnaround. The latest Reuters report on 9 December noted that the FY 2024‑25 export growth of +3.2 % contrasts sharply with the –2.5 % decline recorded in 2018, while the trade‑deficit of ¥1.2 trillion in Q3 2025 is roughly half the record high of ¥2.5 trillion seen in Q4 2018. The yen’s depreciation has also eased, moving from a 5 % fall in 2018 to a 2 % slide YTD 2025, reducing import‑price pressure. GDP, which stalled at an annualised 0.7 % in Q4 2018, is now forecast to grow around 1.5 % in FY 2025, reflecting a more resilient external demand environment. 

The tariff basket itself has not shifted – the United States still levies 25 % on steel and 10 % on aluminium under Section 232, and about $370 billion of Chinese imports remain subject to an average 7.5 % duty under Section 301. What has changed is the nature of the friction: the Biden administration’s “tech‑restriction” policy now targets advanced semiconductors and AI chips, limiting exposure to a narrower set of high‑value sectors rather than the broad import shock of 2018. Tourist arrivals, which plunged 30 % in 2018, have rebounded to an 8 % year‑on‑year increase in Q2 2025, further cushioning the economy. 

Ueda’s optimism was echoed by the business community. The Tankan survey released on the same day showed non‑manufacturers’ confidence index at +12 – the strongest reading since 1991 – and manufacturers at +3, while firms projected a 3.1 % rise in capital expenditure for FY 2025‑26. METI Minister Ken Saito, speaking on 24 March, pledged continued coordination with the BOJ and “flexible policy management” to address any future trade‑policy shocks, noting the policy rate remains at 0.5 %. By contrast, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato warned on 17 April that the Q3 2025 GDP contraction of 0.6 % underscored lingering vulnerability, particularly if tariff pressures were to intensify. Former BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda, in a September interview, dismissed the tariffs as “out of touch” with U.S. realities but reiterated that the 2 % inflation target remains achievable only if trade frictions stay contained. 

Overall, the 2025‑26 trade‑tension impact appears roughly half as severe as the 2018‑19 episode across key metrics – export growth, trade deficit, currency depreciation and GDP performance. The economy’s resilience, reflected in buoyant business sentiment and modest cap‑ex plans, supports Ueda’s assessment. Nonetheless, the persistence of the original tariff regime and the emergence of technology‑export controls mean that vigilance remains essential, especially for export‑oriented sectors that continue to navigate a complex global trade landscape.
