**BoJ Governor Says Japan’s Economy Has Weathered Trump‑Era Tariffs**

*The Bank of Japan’s chief, Kazuo Ueda, told a press conference on 14 March 2024 that Japan has “weathered” the impact of the United States’ steel, aluminium and China‑related duties introduced under the Trump administration – a view now supported by a modest rebound in GDP and a tariff regime that is milder than its 2018‑19 peak.*【Bloomberg】(https://r.jina.ai/<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-14/ueda-says-japan-economy-weathered-trump-tariffs>)

The United States still levies the 25 % steel and 10 % aluminium tariffs first imposed in March 2018, but the broader China‑focused duties have been softened. Today’s structure covers $570 bn of Chinese imports – roughly 30 % of U.S. Chinese trade – with a weighted average rate of about 12 % (7.5 % on $370 bn plus 25 % on $200 bn). By contrast, the 2018‑19 trade‑war peak covered $550 bn at an average of 18 %, driven by a larger share of 25 % duties. Both periods generate roughly $30 bn a year in tariff revenue, but the current mix spreads the burden across a wider base at lower rates【Research Notes】.

Japan’s own macro‑data show that the immediate shock of the tariffs coincided with a dip in real GDP: YoY growth fell from +0.6 % in FY 2018 to –0.4 % in FY 2019, before plunging to –4.2 % in FY 2020 – the latter figure also reflecting the COVID‑19 pandemic【countryeconomy.com】. From FY 2021 onward the economy recovered, posting +2.7 % (2021), +0.9 % (2022), +1.5 % (2023) and a marginal +0.1 % (2024). The trajectory aligns with Governor Ueda’s assessment that the tariff shock has been absorbed, even if the overall size of the economy has contracted by about 13 % between FY 2018 and FY 2024 when measured in nominal terms【countryeconomy.com】.

The shift in tariff intensity matters for Japanese exporters and manufacturers. The steel and aluminium duties, which raise the cost of imported inputs, remain unchanged, yet the lower average Chinese‑goods tariff reduces downstream price pressures on consumer‑industrial products. This milder regime, coupled with a stable policy environment since the Phase One agreement of early 2020, has allowed firms to adjust supply chains without the abrupt cost spikes that characterised the 2018‑19 rounds (July 2018, September 2018, May 2019)【Research Notes】.

In sum, the United States’ current tariff architecture is broader in dollar terms but gentler in percentage terms than the original trade‑war onslaught. Japan’s economy, after a pandemic‑induced trough, has returned to modest growth and appears to have internalised the remaining duties. The BoJ governor’s comment reflects a consensus among policymakers that the worst‑case scenario has passed, even as the legacy 25 % steel and 10 % aluminium tariffs linger.
