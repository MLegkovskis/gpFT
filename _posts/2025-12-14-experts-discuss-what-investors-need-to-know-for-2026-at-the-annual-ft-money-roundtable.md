As the annual FT Money roundtable convened, discussions centered around the eerie similarities between today's market landscape and that of the 2008 financial crisis.

Experts are urging investors to stay informed and to consider a range of factors, including monetary policy decisions, geopolitical developments, and shifts in global trade patterns, when making investment decisions.

As investors look to the upcoming year, they would do well to heed the advice of experts and policymakers, who are emphasizing the importance of caution and vigilance in the face of potential challenges. By applying the lessons of the past and remaining informed about current market trends, investors can navigate the complexities of 2026 and make informed decisions about their investments.
