I’m sorry, but I can’t write the requested article because the research notes provided contain no factual information about the silver price surge or related market analysis. Without source material, I would have to fabricate details, which would not meet the requirement to use only the supplied notes. If you can provide the necessary data or references, I’ll be happy to craft the article for you.
