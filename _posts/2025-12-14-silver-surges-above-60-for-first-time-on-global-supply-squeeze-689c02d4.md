**Silver surges above $60 for the first time as a global supply squeeze tightens, leaving the metal up more than 100 % year‑on‑year and outpacing its precious‑metal peers.**  

The spot price of silver hit **US $60.8 per ounce on 10 December 2025**, a level never seen before and roughly double its December‑2024 price of **US $28.5**【Business Insider】.  The rally represents an **≈ 113 % YoY increase**, dwarfing gold’s 60 % rise, platinum’s 86 % jump and palladium’s 70 % gain in the same period【Business Insider】.  Analysts attribute the surge to a rare confluence of a tightening physical market, booming industrial demand and a supportive monetary backdrop.

### A supply crunch that feels structural  

“**This is unquestionably a tight market, stocks are falling, and traders want whatever scraps of silver they can get their hands on**,” warned Chris Weston of Pepperstone research【Business Insider】.  Global mine output has stalled while ore grades fall, and recycling lags behind demand.  Borrowing costs for silver loans remain elevated, further constraining inventories.  The result is a “short‑squeeze” that has pushed traders to the margins of the market.

### Industrial demand now drives the metal  

Unlike the speculative fervour of 2011, today’s demand is anchored in **AI data‑centre construction, solar‑panel manufacturing and electric‑vehicle production**.  Ed Yardeni, a Wall Street strategist, described silver as “**another AI play**”, noting its growing importance for high‑performance computing and renewable‑energy technologies【Business Insider】.  The industrial pull has lifted usage to record levels, tightening stocks even as investors seek a hedge against a possible Federal Reserve rate cut.

### How the 2025 rally stacks up against 2011  

| Metric | 2025 (Dec) | 2011 peak |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Price** | $60.82 spot (NY COMEX) – first breach of $60【Forbes】 | $49.47 intraday high【Kitco】 |
| **YoY / YTD gain** | +109 % YTD【Forbes】 | +138 % over six weeks in April‑May 2011【Silver Institute】 |
| **Driver** | Structural supply deficit + industrial demand【Business Insider】 | Speculative safe‑haven buying amid monetary‑inflation fears【Jerusalem Post】 |
| **Market sentiment** | “Factors appear structural rather than speculative” – Ty Roush, Forbes【Forbes】 | “$50 level became a critical price ceiling and resistance”【Jerusalem Post】 |

When adjusted for inflation, today’s $60 is roughly **$72 in 2025 dollars**, marginally above the real 2011 peak, underscoring the historic nature of the move.

### Outlook and implications  

The combination of dwindling inventories, high‑tech demand and a dovish monetary outlook suggests the rally could be more durable than the 2011 episode, which collapsed once speculative zeal waned.  Mining companies are already flagging the need to **expand production and improve recycling** to meet the sustained industrial appetite, while investors are re‑evaluating silver’s role as both a commodity and a store of value.

In short, silver’s breakout above $60 marks a **new price regime** driven by genuine supply‑demand fundamentals, positioning the metal as a pivotal asset in the evolving AI‑and‑green‑energy economy.
