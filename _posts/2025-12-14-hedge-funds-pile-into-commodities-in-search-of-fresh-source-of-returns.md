**Hedge funds pile into commodities in search of fresh source of returns**
Hedge funds are increasingly turning to commodities as a means of generating returns, with prominent managers such as Ray Dalio and Carl Icahn allocating significant portions of their portfolios to commodity-related assets. According to data, the total value of hedge fund investments in commodities has increased by approximately $45 billion over the past quarter, with the Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM) posting a 16% gain in 2022 - its largest annual gain since 2008. 

As Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, notes, "You need to have a piece of that portfolio that will do well with accelerated inflation, so you would want a percentage in gold and commodities." His All-Weather portfolio allocates 7.5% to gold and 7.5% to other commodities, with a focus on providing a "2-3% annual real-return buffer" in high-inflation regimes. In contrast, Icahn, a well-known activist investor, treats commodity-linked businesses as "real-asset value plays" and has a significant exposure to oil and gas producers, which he believes are "the best-priced real assets right now."

The current commodity market trends are characterized by a mild contango, indicating ample inventories, and a projected decline in prices over the next two years. In contrast, the 2008 financial crisis saw a sharp boom-and-bust cycle in commodity prices, driven by speculative excess and a subsequent credit crunch. As one expert notes, "the surge in commodity prices could reignite volatility similar to 2008" if a sharp demand shock hits. However, hedge funds are now more diversified, with a focus on metals, energy, and agriculture, and are using hedging structures to manage risk.

The lessons from the 2008 crisis are clear: keep an eye on net inflows, use inventory-based signals, diversify across commodity classes, hedge against macro-policy risk, maintain liquidity buffers, and monitor correlation. As one analyst notes, "the present-day rally is moderate and backed by structural demand, rather than pure speculative euphoria." However, the risk of a sudden demand shock or policy shock remains, and hedge funds must be prepared to adapt to changing market conditions.

In conclusion, hedge funds are increasingly turning to commodities as a means of generating returns, with a focus on diversification, risk management, and hedging. While the current market trends are characterized by a mild contango and a projected decline in prices, the lessons from the 2008 crisis remain relevant, and hedge funds must be prepared to navigate the complexities of the commodity market.
