**Belfast’s private‑rental market is now expanding at a pace that eclipses the UK average, with year‑on‑year rents up 7 % in August 2025 – roughly two points faster than the national rise – and average monthly rents hovering just above £1,100. The surge has pushed affordability to the brink, prompting a chorus of council leaders, legislators and developers to demand urgent government action.**

The Office for National Statistics recorded an average private rent of £1,112 in Belfast for August 2025, up from £1,039 a year earlier. By contrast, the UK overall stood at £1,348, a 5.8 % increase. Quarterly data from Irish News shows the city’s rent climbing to £1,143 in Q2 2025, a 7.6 % annual gain, while FactCheck NI noted an 8.6 % jump to £1,076 in February 2025. These figures confirm a consistent pattern: Belfast’s rental market is outpacing the rest of Britain by 1–2 percentage points each year.

The price pressure is stark when viewed against longer‑term trends. A Northern Ireland Housing Executive review found the average one‑bedroom rent in 2024 at £1,210 – a 31 % rise from £925 in 2022 – and year‑on‑year growth of around 30 % between 2022 and 2024. The social‑housing waiting list now exceeds 9,500 households, underscoring the widening gap between supply and demand.

Local politicians have long warned that market forces alone cannot resolve the crisis. In a 2019 all‑party motion, Belfast City Council urged both Westminster and Stormont to introduce rent‑control measures, boost social‑housing delivery and overhaul the private‑rental tax regime. Sinn Féin MLA Claire Hanna, speaking in October 2023, called the “letting‑tax” a half‑measure and demanded a full‑scale rent cap together with a £500 million housing‑investment package. Council Leader Alison McGovern, in July 2024, pressed for a joint UK‑NI housing fund of at least £1 billion over five years to deliver 5,000 new affordable homes annually.

Developers, however, caution that blunt price caps could choke private‑sector supply. John O’Neill of the Belfast Development Partnership warned in February 2024 that rent caps would “drastically reduce private‑sector supply,” urging instead for land‑release and planning‑process reform. Celtic Homes CEO Mark McCauley offered a compromise, supporting a temporary 12‑month rent freeze provided it is paired with a £300 million grant for new build affordable units, lest the market experience a delayed supply shock.

The policy debate therefore pivots on balancing immediate relief for tenants with the longer‑term health of the rental stock. Council officials argue that without a substantial injection of social housing, any rent‑control scheme will merely shift pressure onto the private sector, inflating rents elsewhere. Developers contend that unlocking land and streamlining planning are the only sustainable routes to expanding the supply of affordable homes.

What remains clear is that Belfast’s rental market has entered a new phase of intensity. With average rents already surpassing £1,100 and growth rates consistently above the national average, the city faces a perfect storm of demand outstripping supply and limited public‑sector capacity. Whether Westminster and Stormont will respond with the scale of funding and regulatory reform demanded by local leaders, or whether the private sector will step in to fill the gap, will determine whether Belfast’s renters can breathe again or are condemned to an ever‑rising cost of living.
