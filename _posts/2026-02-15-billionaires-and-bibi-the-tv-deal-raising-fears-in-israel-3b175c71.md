The recent sale of a 15% stake in Channel 13, an Israeli TV channel, to telecom magnate Patrick Drahi has sparked widespread concern among journalists, opposition politicians, and the public. The deal, announced on February 13, 2026, has been labeled as an 'unlawful deal' by the Union of Journalists in Israel, who warn that it could lead to a loss of press freedom and increased government influence over the media. 

 Channel 13 has historically been a critical voice in Israeli media, running investigations into Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's financial dealings. The sale to Drahi, who already owns other media outlets that are seen as less critical of the government, has raised fears that the channel's editorial line will shift to become more pro-government. 

 The timing of the deal, just months before the scheduled national elections in November 2026, has also prompted concerns that it could impact the political landscape. Opposition MK Yair Lahav has warned that the sale gives the prime minister a 'direct line into a major news outlet' and could skew the campaign. 

 The financial context of the deal has also raised eyebrows, with Drahi's empire being heavily indebted and involved in a US creditor lawsuit. This has led to concerns that Channel 13 could become financially dependent on Drahi, undermining its editorial independence. 

 The public's anxiety about the deal is reflected in a June 2025 poll by the Israel Democracy Institute, which found that 68% of Israelis are worried that media-ownership concentration will favor the ruling party. 

 In conclusion, the sale of a 15% stake in Channel 13 to Patrick Drahi has significant implications for the Israeli media landscape and the country's political landscape. The deal has raised concerns about press freedom, government influence, and the potential for media bias ahead of the 2026 elections.
