**The stock market winners and losers of 2025**

The year 2025 has produced a stark dichotomy in equity performance, with a handful of speculative‑driven stocks delivering astronomical gains while several established technology and consumer‑goods firms suffered precipitous declines. According to year‑end round‑ups published in late November, Regencell Bioscience Holdings (RGC) surged more than 11,800 % – the most dramatic rally of any listed security – whereas Fiserv (FISV) slumped 70.3 %, the deepest fall among the tracked losers. The breadth of these movements underscores a market increasingly driven by niche biotech breakthroughs and AI hype, contrasted with a correction in high‑growth digital advertising and apparel names.

At the top of the gainers list, Regencell Bioscience Holdings Ltd. (RGC) posted an 11,830 % increase, a meteoric rise that dwarfs typical market rallies. Close behind, QMMM Holdings Ltd. (QMMM) climbed 9,228 %, while Diginex Ltd. (DGNX) added 2,719 % to its valuation. Super X AI Technology Ltd. (SUPX) and Abivax (ABVX) completed the quintet of super‑performers with gains of 1,620 % and 1,059 % respectively. All five firms are listed on exchanges where the primary currency is recorded, and their performance was captured in a US News Money summary dated 30 November 2025. The common thread among these winners is a focus on cutting‑edge life‑science and artificial‑intelligence platforms, sectors that have attracted speculative capital amid expectations of transformative breakthroughs.

In stark contrast, the losers’ table is dominated by firms that once epitomised high‑growth digital and consumer trends. Fiserv (FISV) recorded the steepest decline, shedding 70.3 % of its market value by 28 November 2025, according to Bankrate. The Trade Desk (TTD) followed with a 66.8 % drop, reflecting a broader pull‑back in programmatic advertising spend. Deckers Outdoor Corp. (DECK) fell 57.1 %, while Gartner (IT) and Lululemon Athletica (LULU) each lost more than half of their year‑to‑date value, down 52.2 % and 51.7 % respectively. These losses illustrate the vulnerability of established technology and lifestyle brands to shifting consumer sentiment and tighter monetary conditions.

The magnitude of both the gains and the losses is noteworthy. While the top five gainers collectively added well over 25,000 % in value, the five biggest losers erased more than 300 % of their combined market capitalisation. Such extremes suggest a market in which capital is rapidly reallocating from mature, cash‑flow‑driven businesses to high‑risk, high‑reward ventures. Investors have clearly rewarded firms positioned at the frontier of biotech and AI, even as they punished those perceived to be over‑valued or exposed to slowing demand.

For market participants, the 2025 landscape serves as a reminder that extraordinary upside can coexist with equally dramatic downside. Portfolio construction will likely require a more disciplined approach to sector exposure, with heightened scrutiny on valuation multiples and the sustainability of growth narratives. As the year draws to a close, the performance data compiled by US News Money and Bankrate provides a clear, if unsettling, snapshot of where capital has flowed – and where it has fled.
