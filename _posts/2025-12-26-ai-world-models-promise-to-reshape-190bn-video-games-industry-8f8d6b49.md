**AI “world models” are set to touch more than half of the $190 billion global video‑games market within the next five years, meaning over $95 billion of development pipelines could be reshaped by generative 3‑D environment technology.** 

The projection stems from a 2024 Bain & Company survey of senior gaming executives, which found that AI will contribute to “more than half of the video‑game development process in the next 5 to 10 years.” Extrapolating the same trajectory to the nearer‑term suggests that by 2029 AI‑driven world‑model systems will be embedded across a majority of titles, from indie releases to blockbuster AAA franchises. DeepMind’s Genie 3 project lead Shlomi Fruchter has warned that the shift “could be transformative,” underscoring the strategic urgency for studios to adopt the technology now.

World‑model AI differs fundamentally from the rule‑based tools that dominated the 1990s and early 2000s. Earlier systems—such as A* path‑finding in *Doom* (1993) or the “AI Director” in *Left 4 Dead* (2008)—were engineered to manage isolated gameplay elements: enemy navigation, adaptive difficulty, or scripted events. Their techniques relied on finite‑state machines, decision trees and hand‑crafted scripts, delivering modest efficiency gains but leaving core content creation untouched. By contrast, modern world‑model platforms—exemplified by DeepMind’s Genie 2 (2024) and World Labs’ Marble (December 2023)—are large‑scale generative models trained on billions of image and geometry tokens. They can synthesize entire 3‑D spaces, complete with physics, lighting and narrative cues, from a single textual prompt. In practice, Marble can produce a full scene in minutes, a task that previously required weeks of manual modelling.

The economic ramifications are stark. A typical AAA title now commands budgets exceeding $1 billion and development cycles of three to five years; *Grand Theft Auto V* (2013) is a benchmark. World‑model tools promise to shave months off these timelines, reducing labour‑intensive asset pipelines and potentially lowering overall spend. If studios can generate playable maps in minutes, the cost‑benefit calculus shifts dramatically, opening space for risk‑taking and rapid iteration—an outcome highlighted by DeepMind’s Alexandre Moufarek, who said the technology “gives developers room to ‘find the fun’ and ‘try new ideas and take risks again.’”

Industry sentiment reinforces the strategic weight of the shift. A Financial Times report (26 December 2025) quoted Google DeepMind and World Labs as arguing that world models could “reshape the $190 bn video‑games industry.” Bain’s executives echoed this optimism, noting that AI will improve quality and speed‑to‑market, even as it does not resolve the underlying talent shortage. The consensus is clear: AI is moving from a peripheral assistant to a core engine of creation.

The transition also carries technical implications. Early AI ran on CPUs or GPUs at frame‑rate, with no learning from massive datasets. World‑model inference now leverages specialised tensor cores, and studios can fine‑tune models on proprietary asset libraries, ensuring stylistic consistency while retaining generative flexibility. This depth of integration enables dynamic, player‑driven worlds that evolve in real time—a capability unattainable with static rule‑based systems.

In sum, AI world‑model technology is poised to become the dominant force in game development, affecting more than half of the $190 billion market and redefining how interactive experiences are built. Studios that embed these models early will likely capture a competitive edge, while those that cling to legacy pipelines risk obsolescence in an industry on the cusp of a generative renaissance.
