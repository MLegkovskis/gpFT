# EU agrees €90bn loan to Ukraine after frozen Russian asset plan fails 

**The European Union has approved a €90 billion interest‑free loan to Ukraine, backed by the EU’s common budget, after a stalemate over the use of frozen Russian state assets blocked a larger financing proposal. The two‑year loan, announced on 19 December 2025, is intended to cover the bulk of Ukraine’s projected €135 billion budget gap over the next two years. EU Council President Antonio Costa hailed the decision as “defending the future of our continent”, while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the bloc for “significant support that truly strengthens our resilience”.** 

The loan marks a dramatic escalation in the scale of EU financial assistance to Kyiv. At €90 billion it is roughly 75 times larger than the €1.2 billion macro‑financial assistance (MFA) package approved in February 2022. The 2022 MFA, enacted under Council Decision (EU) 2022/313, was a one‑off grant‑loan aimed at stabilising Ukraine’s public finances in the immediate aftermath of the Russian invasion, shoring up the budget and debt‑service capacity. By contrast, the 2025 instrument is a short‑term, budget‑backed borrowing operation that will be disbursed immediately and repaid without interest after two years. 

The loan’s legal basis is a council decision on a joint EU borrowing operation adopted on the day of the announcement. It differs from the earlier MFA, which relied on a dedicated EU budget line for exceptional macro‑financial assistance. The new financing is not tied to frozen Russian assets; instead the EU will raise the funds on the capital markets and guarantee repayment from its own budget. This shift was forced by a political impasse: Belgium, wielding a veto, demanded liability guarantees for any use of the frozen assets, effectively blocking the €210 billion plan that had been under discussion. The compromise reached reflects a broader consensus that Ukraine’s fiscal shortfall must be addressed without further delay, even as member states remain divided on the Russian‑asset issue. 

Strategically, the loan is designed to plug a multi‑year budgetary shortfall rather than merely stabilise immediate cash‑flow pressures. The EU’s common borrowing capacity, outlined in a 2025 Institut Jacques Delors paper on the future of common borrowing, provides the institutional framework for such large‑scale, budget‑backed financing. By guaranteeing the loan, the EU signals a willingness to shoulder a substantial portion of Ukraine’s fiscal burden, reinforcing the bloc’s political commitment to the country’s defence and reconstruction. 

The €90 billion package also underscores the evolution of the EU’s response to the conflict. The 2022 MFA was a modest, emergency measure, reflecting the urgency of the early‑war period and a broad, albeit cautious, consensus among member states. Five years on, the EU is prepared to mobilise a financing instrument of unprecedented magnitude, albeit still short of the €210 billion frozen‑asset proposal that some leaders had hoped to deploy. The loan’s interest‑free nature and two‑year repayment horizon are intended to provide Ukraine with breathing space while the bloc continues to explore longer‑term solutions, including the contentious asset‑based approach. 

In sum, the €90 billion loan represents the EU’s most substantial direct financial commitment to Ukraine to date, a decisive step that bridges the gap between an early‑war emergency grant and a longer‑term economic partnership. While the frozen‑asset plan remains stalled, the loan demonstrates that the EU can marshal its common budget to deliver swift, large‑scale support when political consensus on alternative mechanisms falters.
