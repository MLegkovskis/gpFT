I’m sorry, but the research notes you provided contain only error messages and no substantive information about the U.S. Justice Department’s probe of Jay Powell. Without source material to draw from, I cannot produce a factual article that meets the required word count and style guidelines. If you can supply concrete notes or data on the investigation, I’ll be happy to draft the piece for you.
