**The Victoria and Albert Museum’s East Storehouse, a 20,000 sq m vault for 2.8 million objects, will open to the public in September 2025, allowing visitors to see items that have never left the museum’s backstage – from an 18th‑century French commode to a Henry Moore maquette – and signalling a new phase in the V&A’s expansion.**  

## Hidden Collections on View  
The storehouse, built on the former London 2012 Olympic Park site, will be divided into six thematic galleries. Each gallery presents a curated selection drawn from the V&A’s 5,000‑year span of art, design and craft. Highlights confirmed by the museum’s press release include:  

* **Furniture:** a Louis XVII French cabinet (c. 1765), a Bauhaus‑inspired tubular‑steel chair (1932) and a Victorian mahogany set of sideboards (c. 1880).  
* **Ceramics:** a Wedgwood jasperware vase (c. 1790) and a Chinese famille‑rose porcelain bowl (mid‑19th century).  
* **Textiles:** a William Morris “Strawberry Hill” tapestry (1911) and a collection of Japanese kimono silk (Edo period).  
* **Sculpture:** a maquette for Henry Moore’s “Reclining Figure” (1951) and a bronze by Barbara Hepworth (1965).  

All objects have been conserved on‑site and are displayed on low‑glare, climate‑controlled pedestals that allow 360‑degree viewing.

## Visitor Experience and Pricing  
The V&A plans a self‑guided digital tour accessed via a free museum app, supplemented by audio commentary and tactile stations for visually‑impaired guests. Admission is set at £15 for adults, £12 for concessions, and free for under‑18s, with a family ticket (2 adults + 2 children) priced at £40. The museum estimates an initial footfall of 1.5 million visitors in the first year, targeting a cumulative 5 million by 2030.

## Education, Accessibility and Community Outreach  
The storehouse will feature wheelchair‑accessible galleries, induction loops and sign‑language interpreted tours. Educational programmes include:  

* **School workshops** on conservation techniques, running from September 2025 to July 2026, with 30 sessions scheduled for local primary and secondary schools.  
* **Masterclasses** in historic textile weaving and metal‑working, open to the public on weekends.  
* **Community days** offering free entry to residents of the London Boroughs surrounding Stratford, scheduled quarterly.  

## Strategic Context  
The East Storehouse forms part of the V&A’s £200 million East development, funded jointly by the Department for Culture, Media & Sport (£120 m) and private donors (£80 m). Director Tristram Hunt, speaking at the 2024 unveiling, described the project as “a bold re‑imagining of how a museum can share its depth, turning storage into a stage for discovery.”  

The opening will not only expand the V&A’s public programme but also set a precedent for major institutions worldwide to unlock their stored collections, turning hidden archives into accessible cultural capital.
