**The Victoria and Albert Museum’s new East Storehouse opened to the public on 31 May 2025, offering free, seven‑day‑a‑week access to more than half a million objects—including fashion, ceramics, furniture and archival material—within a 170 000 sq ft (≈15 800 m²) purpose‑built facility in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.**  

## A Working Store as Visitor Destination  

Designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, the East Storehouse functions simultaneously as a high‑capacity storage hub and a museum experience. The building houses five permanent display zones and a “Order an Object” service that lets visitors book a time‑slot to view a specific item from the V&A’s 2.5 million‑object collection, a model of transparency rarely seen in institutions of its size.  

## Collections on Show  

From 2 June 2025 the National Art Library’s rare books and design archives, previously stored at Blythe House, have been made accessible in a dedicated study centre. Highlights include a 1954 Balenciaga evening dress (the most‑ordered object to date), a 19th‑century Chinese porcelain pagoda, and a selection of William Morris textiles. The storehouse also hosts the David Bowie Centre, which opened on 13 September 2025 and showcases over 90 000 items from the late singer’s personal archive.  

## Conservation, Research and Employment  

The site contains a state‑of‑the‑art conservation laboratory where specialists treat everything from Samurai swords to mid‑century furniture. Over 70 new jobs have been created across the two East Bank sites, supporting the museum’s commitment to the four Olympic boroughs. The facility’s digital platform provides high‑resolution images and metadata for all objects, facilitating remote research for scholars worldwide.  

## Public Programme and Accessibility  

Admission is free, though certain exhibitions and talks carry a separate charge. The programme includes rotating displays, workshops, and talks such as “The Music Is Black: A British Story” and a series of micro‑residencies where artists spend four days researching the collection before presenting their findings. The building is fully accessible, with wheelchair‑friendly routes, accessible toilets and a café overlooking the park’s riverside terrace.  

## Looking Ahead: V&A East Museum  

The East Storehouse is the first phase of the V&A East development. The companion V&A East Museum, slated to open in spring 2026, will expand the narrative of “making” with additional galleries, a larger exhibition space and further community‑led projects. Together, the two sites aim to reposition the V&A as a model of open‑access stewardship for one of the world’s largest applied‑arts collections.  

Visitors can plan their visit, book object viewings and explore the digital catalogue via the V&A’s official website.
