**The V&A East Storehouse: Unlocking a New Era of Cultural Tourism and Economic Growth in East London**
The V&A East Storehouse, a groundbreaking museum experience, has opened its doors to the public, offering a **completely new cultural experience** that is **on a scale unimaginable until now**, according to Tim Reeve, Deputy Director & COO of the Victoria and Albert Museum. This innovative project is poised to drive cultural tourism and economic growth in East London, with key stakeholders, including museum curators and local politicians, hailing it as a **catalyst for cultural tourism**.

Located in the former London 2012 Olympic Media Centre, the V&A East Storehouse is a **160,000 sq ft** facility that showcases over **250,000 objects**, **350,000 library books**, and **1,000 archival series**, making it the **largest publicly accessible collection-storage facility in the UK**. This unprecedented public access to the V&A's reserve collections is expected to attract **1.5 million visitors in its first year**, generating **£120 million** in economic activity and supporting **800 new jobs**, as stated by Helen Hughes, Director-General, Culture & Creative Industries, Greater London Authority.

The V&A East Storehouse is a strategic economic engine that is projected to attract **1.5 million+ visitors**, generate **£120-£200 million+** in annual economic activity, and create **800-1,200 jobs** (plus thousands of ancillary business opportunities) within its first few years. The project is also expected to **put East London on the world-tourist map** and help **revitalise the local economy**, building on the legacy of the 2012 Olympics, as stated by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.

As a **cultural hub**, the V&A East Storehouse is designed to **attract visitors, researchers, and creatives, driving footfall to the area and supporting local businesses**. The project is part of a wider **East Bank regeneration scheme**, which is expected to create **10,000 jobs** and deliver **£1.5 billion of economic activity over the next decade**. The Storehouse is also **integral to a £1.5 billion, 10-year economic uplift** for East London, contributing to **10,000 jobs** and adding to the **£700 million GVA** already recorded for the campus.

According to the V&A's strategic plan, the Storehouse is designed to **bring behind-the-scenes access** to the V&A collection for **16-24-year-olds** from the six Olympic boroughs, acting as a **gateway to other museum experiences**. The project has also been endorsed by local politicians, including Kate Osamor, Local MP for West Ham, who stated that investing in the V&A East Storehouse is **investment in jobs, apprenticeships, and small-business growth** for local constituents.

In terms of its historical context, the V&A East Storehouse is a **historically pivotal project** that resolves a 2015-era storage crisis caused by the sale of Blythe House and re-imagines museum storage as a **public exhibition space**, a first for a major UK institution. The project embeds the V&A within the **post-2012 Olympic legacy** and the emerging **East Bank cultural corridor**, shifting London's museum geography eastward.

Overall, the V&A East Storehouse is a **groundbreaking museum experience** that is set to drive cultural tourism and economic growth in East London, while also redefining the traditional museum model and providing unprecedented public access to the V&A's reserve collections.
