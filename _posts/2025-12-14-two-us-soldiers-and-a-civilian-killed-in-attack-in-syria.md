**Two US soldiers and a civilian killed in attack in Syria**
**Attack highlights lingering threat of ISIS and raises questions on US presence in the region**

A recent attack in central Syria has resulted in the deaths of two US soldiers and a civilian interpreter, marking the first combat-related US fatalities in the country since 2019. The incident occurred on December 13, 2025, near the historic city of Palmyra, Homs province, and was claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group. The attack has sparked a strong reaction from the White House, with President Donald Trump vowing "very serious retaliation" against those responsible.

According to reports from [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-syrian-military-patrol-comes-under-fire-central-syria-officials-say-2025-12-13/) and [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/2-u-s-service-members-1-civilian-killed-in-ambush-in-syria-central-command-says), the victims were part of a joint US-Syrian security patrol conducting a "key leader engagement" when they were ambushed by a lone gunman linked to IS. The perpetrator was killed by partner forces during the engagement.

The incident has significant implications for regional stability, with [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-soldiers-civilian-interpreter-killed-ambush-syria-apparent/story?id=128376036) noting that it marks a resurgence of ISIS-linked activity in central Syria after a multi-year lull. The attack also raises questions about the effectiveness of the US-led coalition's efforts to combat ISIS and the need for a continued US military presence in the region.

In response to the attack, the Pentagon has emphasized the importance of continued cooperation with Syrian security forces to combat the threat of ISIS. However, the incident is likely to prompt a renewed debate in Congress about the US military presence in Syria and the broader Middle East. [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/13/joint-syrian-us-patrol-comes-under-attack-near-palmyra-state-media) reports that lawmakers are already calling for a review of US strategy in the region.

The current US military deployment size in Syria is approximately 2,000 troops, with around 900 on long-term deployments and 1,100 on temporary rotational assignments. The [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/23/politics/us-troop-syria-pentagon) reports that the US has been working to increase its presence in the region to combat the threat of ISIS.

The incident has also raised concerns about the overall casualty count since the start of the conflict. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_intervention_in_the_Syrian_civil_war), the total US death toll in Syria now stands at 15, including 12 service members and 3 civilian contractors. The [ABC 7](https://abc7.com/18283491/) reports that the latest incident is a sobering reminder of the risks faced by US personnel serving in the region.

In conclusion, the recent attack in Syria highlights the ongoing threat of ISIS and raises important questions about the US military presence in the region. As the situation continues to unfold, it is likely that the US will face increased pressure to re-evaluate its strategy and consider new approaches to combating the threat of terrorism in the Middle East.
