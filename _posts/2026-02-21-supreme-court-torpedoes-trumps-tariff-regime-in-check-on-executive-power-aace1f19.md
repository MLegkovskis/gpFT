### Supreme Court Torpedoes Trump’s Tariff Regime
The Supreme Court has made a landmark decision, striking down Trump's tariff regime in a significant check on executive power. The ruling, made on February 20, 2026, has far-reaching implications for the balance of power in the US, particularly in regards to trade policy.

The case, *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, saw the Court rule that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the President the power to impose tariffs. The decision was made with a 6-3 vote, with Chief Justice John Roberts and five liberal/centrist justices voting in favor of the ruling.

The Court applied the major-questions doctrine, stating that when Congress delegates power of vast economic significance, it must do so clearly. The ruling also highlighted the Constitutional allocation of power, with the Framers not vesting any part of the taxing power in the Executive Branch.

The decision has significant implications for the economy, with $133 billion in revenue generated by the invalidated tariffs and a projected $3 trillion in aggregate cost to US importers and consumers over the next decade. The ruling also limits the President's ability to use emergency statutes for fiscal measures and strengthens judicial oversight of major questions.

The administration has already responded to the decision, with Trump issuing a proclamation invoking Section 122 to impose a 10% global tariff, capped at 15% and limited to 150 days. However, this move is seen as a temporary measure, and any future broad tariff regime will require explicit statutory authority or new legislation.

### Implications and Takeaways
The decision reasserts Congressional supremacy over tariff-making, requiring explicit statutory authority for future broad tariff regimes. The ruling also limits the President's ability to use emergency statutes for fiscal measures and strengthens judicial oversight of major questions.

The implications of the decision are far-reaching, with significant effects on the economy, trade policy, and the balance of power in the US. The ruling creates immediate fiscal and legal questions about refunds, retroactive adjustments, and the future of the IEEPA-based trade strategy.
