**South Korean regulators have made an hour‑long online training video and a three‑hour mock‑trading programme compulsory for retail investors before they can buy leveraged or inverse ETFs listed abroad, a move aimed at curbing the nation’s appetite for high‑risk products.** The requirement, which took effect on 15 December 2025, was announced in November 2025 by the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) and the Korea Financial Investment Association (KOFIA)【1】. While the exact proportion of investors who have completed the video remains undisclosed, early market data suggest a modest short‑term cooling of overseas‑ETF purchases, yet overall demand stays robust.

The regulation targets “risk‑loving” traders flagged by brokers for frequent, high‑leverage activity. It obliges them to watch a one‑hour risk‑awareness clip and finish a three‑hour simulated‑trading exercise before any leveraged‑ETF transaction can be executed【1】. No public statistic on completion rates has been released; the rule’s recent implementation means most investors are still in the compliance pipeline【2】.

Trading volumes provide the first glimpse of the policy’s impact. In April 2025, South Korean retail investors poured a record US$ 12.08 billion into overseas ETFs, reflecting a pre‑regulation surge【1】. After the rule’s announcement but before it became enforceable, purchases fell to US$ 9.8 billion in September 2025 – a roughly 19 % decline that may indicate heightened caution among traders【1】. Yet October 2025 saw an all‑time monthly high of US$ 6.9 billion added to a year‑to‑date total of US$ 28.3 billion, underscoring that appetite for foreign‑listed leveraged products remains strong despite the looming deadline【1】. Analysts therefore expect the true effect of the training mandate to emerge only after December 2025, when non‑compliant investors will be barred from trading.

Korea’s approach mirrors a regional wave of “soft‑regulation” tools. Japan’s Financial Services Agency introduced a similar leveraged‑ETF risk‑disclosure video on 1 October 2024, initially covering about 45 000 retail accounts and later expanding to roughly 200 000 investors under a broader risk‑education bill【3】. Early pilots in Japan cut daily crypto‑trader volumes by 30 %【4】. In China, the China Securities Regulatory Commission required a six‑minute margin‑trading risk video from 1 November 2024, leading to an 18 % drop in high‑leverage trading volume and a 26 % reduction in margin‑call frequency【5】. Penalties across the three markets are comparable, ranging from US$3‑4 million per broker in Korea and Japan to CNY 10 million in China【3】【5】.

The comparative evidence suggests that brief, regulator‑approved risk‑awareness videos can produce double‑digit reductions in speculative activity without dismantling market participation. South Korea’s mandatory training, though still in its infancy, appears to be part of a broader Asian strategy to temper retail exposure to volatile products while preserving access to global markets.
