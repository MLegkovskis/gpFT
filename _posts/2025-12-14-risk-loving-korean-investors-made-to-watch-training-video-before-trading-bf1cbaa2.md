**Risk‑loving Korean investors made to watch training video before trading**

South Korea’s financial watchdogs have moved to curb speculative bets on overseas leveraged and inverse exchange‑traded funds by mandating an hour‑long video and a three‑hour mock‑trading simulation for all retail participants. The rule, which takes effect on 15 December 2025, will block any leveraged‑ETF order until the education module is completed and recorded against the investor’s account. Regulators say the measure is designed to raise risk awareness, temper short‑term speculation and foster a more stable market environment.

The Korea Financial Investment Association (KFIA) framed the policy as a safeguard for market health. It expects a temporary slowdown in trade frequency as investors work through the mandatory content, with a brief dip in turnover before the market settles into “more prudent” portfolio construction. By linking completion records directly to trading permissions, the association believes it can reduce uninformed high‑risk bets and shift sentiment from “risk‑loving” to “risk‑aware”.

Data from Bloomberg, cited in a recent Cryptonews report, shows South Korean retail investors have already poured $28.3 billion into US‑listed ETFs and stocks this year, including a record $6.9 billion in October – the highest monthly total since 2011. The sheer scale of overseas exposure underpins the regulator’s urgency. ETFGI figures for September 2025 reveal a modest pull‑back, with overseas‑ETF purchases falling to $9.8 billion from an April peak of $12.08 billion, and 14 of the top 21 ETFs bought being inverse or leveraged. The decline suggests a natural moderation that the KFIA hopes to reinforce through education rather than bluntly curtail demand.

Industry voices are cautiously optimistic. Bora Kim, head of APAC strategy at Leverage Shares Plc, told Cryptonews that the new rule will help South Korean investors “recognise the compounding effects and strategies of investing in leveraged overseas ETFs”. While the education will address gaps in understanding, Kim does not anticipate a major shift in overall appetite for leveraged products, noting that risk‑neutral retail investors may adjust behaviour but demand is likely to remain stable.

South Korea’s approach is the latest and most stringent in a regional wave of investor‑education mandates. Japan’s Financial Services Agency introduced a 15‑minute online module for leveraged ETFs in March 2023 after retail losses of roughly ¥120 billion in 2022. China’s CSRC required a brief 10‑15‑minute risk‑education course in July 2022 following margin‑call losses of about CNY 3 billion. By contrast, Korea’s rule demands a minimum of four hours – an hour of video plus three hours of simulated trading – and applies to all leveraged or inverse ETFs listed abroad, not just domestic products. The added mock‑trading component is unique, signalling a more proactive stance to pre‑empt risky behaviour rather than merely inform investors after the fact.

In the short term, market participants should expect a measurable dip in turnover as the onboarding process lengthens. Over the longer horizon, regulators anticipate lower volatility and a shift toward more disciplined, long‑term portfolio building. Whether the mandatory education will translate into lasting behavioural change remains to be seen, but the policy marks a decisive step by South Korean authorities to temper the “risk‑loving” culture that has driven a surge in high‑leverage overseas investments.
