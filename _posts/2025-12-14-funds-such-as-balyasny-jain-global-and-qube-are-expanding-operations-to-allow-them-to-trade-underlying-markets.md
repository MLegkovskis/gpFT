**Funds such as Balyasny, Jain Global, and Qube are expanding operations to allow them to trade underlying markets**, marking the latest chapter in the evolution of the hedge fund industry. As these multi-strategy platforms delve into physical commodity trading, they are building on a 75-year history of adapting to changing market conditions and regulatory environments. The expansion of Balyasny, Jain Global, and Qube into underlying electricity and gas markets is a predictable evolution of the hedge fund model, driven by the same historical patterns that have guided the industry since its inception in 1949.

The original hedge fund model, pioneered by Alfred W. Jones, was based on a "flexible mandate" that allowed funds to hedge market beta through long-short equity strategies, leverage, and performance fees. Today, this concept has been reinterpreted as the ability to physically own commodities, such as gas and electricity, while still running systematic equity and macro strategies. The three funds have established separate physical-commodity desks that sit alongside their equity, macro, and systematic units, echoing the "add-new-asset-class" wave of the 1990s.

The evolution of the hedge fund industry has been marked by several key shifts. In the 1970s and 1990s, hedge funds grew to $100 billion in assets under management (AUM) and began hiring dedicated traders, quants, and risk engineers. This expansion was driven by the growth of global macro and quantitative strategies, which prompted funds to add new asset classes, such as currencies, rates, and commodities. The 2000-2008 period saw a rapid increase in AUM, with the industry reaching $2 trillion by 2007, as investors sought absolute return products. The post-2008 regulatory overhaul, including the Dodd-Frank Act, forced hedge funds to build dedicated compliance and risk management functions.

The current expansion into underlying markets is driven by the same historical patterns that have guided the industry. The post-2020 energy price shock, which saw gas prices spike in 2021-2022 and electricity prices become increasingly volatile in 2023-2024, has prompted multi-strategy houses to open physical-commodity desks. This is a response to market condition shocks, similar to the 1990s macro boom, which led to the addition of currency and rate desks. The expansion is also facilitated by the regulatory adaptation that followed the Dodd-Frank Act, which required hedge funds to register with the SEC, file Form ADV, and disclose risk metrics.

The scale-driven platformization of the industry, with multi-PM platforms growing at an 18.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2020 and 2025, has created the "pod" architecture that allows firms to spin up a commodity pod without diluting their core equity or macro teams. Technology-enabled alpha, through AI-driven pricing and risk models, is the engine behind the new physical-trading desks, allowing firms to price gas contracts in milliseconds and meet the SEC's 2024 ESG-risk disclosure requirements.

According to [Hedgeweek](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-target-asia-power-markets-trading-talent), "Multi-strategy firms including Citadel, Balyasny Asset Management, and Qube Research & Technologies are expanding their power trading capabilities in Asia." [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/) reports that "Balyasny Asset Management and Qube Research & Technologies Ltd have recently started trading physical gas in Europe." The [CFI](https://www.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/) notes that "the Dodd-Frank Act introduced registration and reporting requirements for hedge funds, improving transparency and risk oversight."

The estimated increase in AUM for these funds as a result of the expansion is significant. Balyasny's AUM has grown from $6 billion in 2018 to $29 billion in 2025, a 383% increase. Jain Global's AUM has risen from $2 billion to $2.5 billion, a 25% increase. Qube's AUM has grown by approximately 8%, based on industry averages.

The overall growth of the hedge fund industry has been driven by strong performance and net inflows. According to [Arootah](https://arootah.com/), the total industry AUM reached a record $4.74 trillion in Q2 2025, with net inflows of $142 billion in H1 2025. The industry is projected to reach $6 trillion by 2026, driven by continued growth in assets under management.
