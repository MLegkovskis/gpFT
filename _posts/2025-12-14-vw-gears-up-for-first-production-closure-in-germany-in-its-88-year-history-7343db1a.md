**Volkswagen’s first‑ever German plant shutdown – a historic step that threatens thousands of jobs and underscores the auto giant’s urgent shift to electric vehicles.** On 2 September 2024 the group announced the closure of the Wolfsburg body‑shop line that produces the Golf and several EV models, putting roughly 3,000 direct positions and 1,500 supplier jobs at risk. The move, described by CEO Oliver Blume as “a painful but necessary step to align capacity with demand and to accelerate our transition to electric mobility”, marks the first production halt in the company’s 88‑year German history and signals a stark recalibration of capacity amid waning demand for internal‑combustion cars.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz framed the decision as a balancing act, insisting that the plan must “protect jobs while modernising our automotive sector and keeping Germany at the forefront of the electric‑vehicle transition”. The announcement sent a clear warning to the industry: capacity must be trimmed to match a market that is increasingly dominated by Chinese competition and a rapid rollout of EVs. Analysts estimate the revenue hit at around €15 billion – roughly five per cent of Volkswagen’s 2023 turnover – which translates to about 0.35 % of Germany’s €4.2 trillion economy. Including supply‑chain knock‑on effects, the broader drag on GDP could reach 0.3 %–0.5 %.

Intensive negotiations with unions culminated in a deal on 14 December 2025 that averted any permanent plant closure. Blume hailed the agreement as “an important signal for the future viability of the Volkswagen brand”. The settlement foresees a reduction of 35,000 jobs by 2030 through early‑retirement, voluntary exits and redeployment, rather than operational‑reason layoffs. It also suspends a planned 5 % wage rise for 2025‑26, cuts apprenticeship places from 1,400 to 600 per year, and explores shifting some production to Mexico while repurposing the Dresden and Osnabrück sites. Daniela Cavallo, IG Metall works‑council chief, declared that “no site will be closed, no‑one will be laid off for operational reasons and our company wage agreement will be secured for the long term”. Scholz echoed the sentiment, calling the outcome “a good, socially acceptable solution”.

The 2025 episode stands in sharp contrast to Volkswagen’s earlier crisis responses. During the 2008 global financial crisis the group avoided any German plant shutdown, opting instead for a €2 billion cut in capital expenditure and a broader cost‑reduction programme that preserved jobs while still delivering a 13.7 % rise in net profit. The COVID‑19 pandemic in 2020 prompted temporary, localized suspensions – such as the March shutdown of the Chattanooga plant – but again no full‑scale German closure. Those measures focused on liquidity protection and a rapid “100‑point plan” to curb losses after a €1.49 billion first‑half deficit. By contrast, the May 2025 week‑long halt at Wolfsburg – the first complete production stoppage since the company’s 1937 founding – was a deliberate capacity‑adjustment to re‑tool lines for upcoming EV models. It affected about 12 000 workers, roughly five per cent of the Wolfsburg workforce, yet was absorbed by a strong cash‑flow surplus of €12 billion, allowing the group to weather the short‑term output loss without jeopardising solvency.

The closure saga highlights the tension between Germany’s industrial heritage and the imperatives of a green transition. While the immediate threat to thousands of jobs has been softened by the December deal, the longer‑term plan still envisions a substantial reshaping of the workforce, with apprenticeship slots slashed by more than half and a sizeable voluntary exit programme. For a sector that contributes almost 8 % of national GDP, the episode underscores how even the most entrenched manufacturers must confront structural change or risk eroding their competitive edge.
