### Introduction
The nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve chair has significant implications for the US stock market and economy. Warsh's past statements and reputation as an 'inflation hawk' have led investors to expect a more hawkish stance, with potential slower rate cuts and a smaller balance sheet.

### Immediate Market Reaction
The nomination triggered a short-term sell-off in the stock market, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 falling 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. The 10-year Treasury yield rose approximately 5 basis points, while the US dollar strengthened and gold fell 3.9% to $5,144/oz.

### Potential Longer-Term Implications
Warsh's leadership could shape interest-rate policy, with potential implications for borrowing costs. Mortgage rates could fall to the mid-5% range, auto-loan APRs to approximately 5.8%, and prime-linked business loans to approximately 5.25%. This could translate into tangible dollar savings for households and firms.

### Risks and Trade-Offs
However, there are risks associated with Warsh's nomination, including higher inflation, asset-price bubbles, and debt buildup. The Fed's independence perception could also be affected, potentially leading to a 'policy premium' that partially offsets rate-cut benefits.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, Kevin Warsh's nomination as Federal Reserve chair has significant implications for the US stock market and economy. While there are potential benefits to his leadership, including lower borrowing costs, there are also risks that need to be considered.
