### The Downfall of ZestMoney
ZestMoney, a Bengaluru-based Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) fintech, has been at the center of a financial scandal, with hundreds of millions of dollars in investor funds unaccounted for. The company, once valued at **$450 million**, was sold to DMI in a fire-sale, resulting in significant losses for investors.

### Financial Irregularities
Alleged financial irregularities include inflated revenue numbers, mis-stated loan-disbursal figures, and service-deficiency charges of **₹244 crore** in FY-22. The company's non-performing assets (NPAs) were reported at **13%**, which was later contested by the company.

### Recovery Plan
The recovery plan includes the fire-sale to DMI, which will absorb ZestMoney's technology stack, talent, and NBFC licence, and pay an additional **$8 million** to ZestMoney. PhonePe extended an **$18 million** emergency credit line, which is now being pursued for repayment. Lead investors have filed civil suits seeking **damages of up to $100 million** each.

### Legal Consequences
The founders face potential criminal fraud charges, civil liability, and regulatory penalties. The RBI has ordered a forensic audit and frozen accounts, and the Enforcement Directorate has opened a money-laundering case, allowing attachment of personal properties of the founders.
