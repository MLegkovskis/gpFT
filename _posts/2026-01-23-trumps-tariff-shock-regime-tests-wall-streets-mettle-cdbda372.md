### Introduction
The Trump-era tariffs have had a significant impact on the U.S. economy, with various sectors being affected differently. According to recent studies, the tariffs are estimated to reduce U.S. GDP by 0.1-0.2% in the long run.
### Impact on Sectors
The most affected sectors include steel & aluminum, automobiles, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, and technology. These sectors rely heavily on imported inputs, which are now subject to 10-30% duties. For example, the steel and aluminum tariffs have led to a near-complete pass-through of costs to U.S. prices.
### Economic Implications
The tariffs have also led to retaliatory duties from other countries, which are estimated to reduce U.S. GDP by less than 0.05%. The consensus among recent quantitative studies is that the tariffs will have a negative impact on the U.S. economy. However, rolling back the tariffs could increase U.S. output by 4% over three years, according to the IMF.
### Conclusion
In conclusion, the Trump-era tariffs have had a significant impact on the U.S. economy, with various sectors being affected differently. While the tariffs are estimated to reduce U.S. GDP in the long run, rolling them back could lead to a significant increase in U.S. output.
