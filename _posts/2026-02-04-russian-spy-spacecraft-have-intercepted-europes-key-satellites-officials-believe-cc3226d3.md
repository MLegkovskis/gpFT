# Russian Spy Spacecraft Intercept European Satellites
Russian spy spacecraft have been intercepting key European satellites, according to officials. The intercepted satellites include Intelsat 10-02, Athena-Fidus, and German military communications satellites.
## Intercepted Communications
The intercepted communications could be used for electronic warfare, jamming, or kinetic attacks. Officials believe that the Russian spacecraft are capable of capturing unencrypted or weakly encrypted telemetry, command, and payload data.
## Security Implications
The security implications of the intercepted communications are significant. The compromise of NATO command-and-control, vulnerability of civilian services, and enabling of future ASAT weapons are all potential consequences.
## Joint European Response
There are plans for a joint European response to protect satellite communications from future interceptions. The plans include the development of a European-wide space-defence architecture, procurement of electronic-attack-resistant transponders, and creation of a EU Satellite-Security Coordination Centre.
