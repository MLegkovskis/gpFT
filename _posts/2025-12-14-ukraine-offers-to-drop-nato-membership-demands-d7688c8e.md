**Ukraine offers to drop NATO membership demands**

*Kyiv’s willingness to abandon its NATO‑membership demand has been met with cautious optimism from European capitals, while analysts warn that the diplomatic shift could cost Ukraine up to $34 billion in GDP over the next decade and trigger a brief sell‑off in defence‑sector equities.*  

Ukraine announced in June 2024 that it was prepared to “drop the demand for NATO membership” to accelerate peace talks with Moscow【Reuters – “Ukraine offers to drop NATO membership demands” (June 12 2024)】. The move has been welcomed by the EU’s top leaders, who see an opportunity to replace the membership clause with a European‑wide security guarantee. French President Emmanuel Macron stressed France’s “robust and lasting peace” for Ukraine【PBS】, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned that the “decades of the ‘Pax Americana’ are largely over” and hinted at a more Europe‑centric defence architecture【PBS】. Similar sentiments came from Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, Poland’s Mateusz Morawiecki and Britain’s Keir Starmer, all urging concrete security pledges rather than formal NATO accession【various official statements】.  

The economic calculus of the proposal is stark. Ukraine’s nominal GDP stands at **US $209.7 billion** (IMF, 2025)【IMF – World Economic Outlook, 2025】. Historical evidence shows that NATO accession typically lifts per‑capita income by about **15 %** over ten years, equating to an **annualised 1.5 %** boost【Wilson Center】. Applied to Ukraine, this would raise GDP to roughly **US $243.4 billion** in a decade, a gain of **$33.7 billion** (≈ 16 % of current output) that would be forfeited if the demand is dropped【calculation in notes】.  

Defence markets reacted instantly. On 14 December 2025, shares of the sector’s giants fell between **0.9 % and 1.8 %**—Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies, Northrop Grumman and a Europe‑focused defence ETF all slipped as investors priced in a potential reduction in long‑term NATO‑driven orders【market data】. Yet the dip is likely temporary. The United States has already pledged **US$5 billion** in weapons for Ukraine this year, with a projected **US$15 billion** by the end of 2026【NATO Sec‑Gen Mark Rutte】, and European firms stand to benefit from a new EU security guarantee that could channel **€10‑15 billion** into domestic defence suppliers【analyst forecasts】. Consensus forecasts for the next six months still predict **+6 % to +9 %** price gains for the major contractors, driven by multi‑year contracts that are independent of NATO membership status【Bloomberg/Refinitiv outlook】.  

In sum, Kyiv’s diplomatic flexibility has unlocked a window for a European‑led security framework, earning diplomatic applause across Brussels, Berlin and London. The trade‑off is a sizeable, though model‑based, foregone boost to Ukraine’s economy—potentially $34 billion over ten years. Meanwhile, defence stocks have taken a modest, short‑lived hit, but the underlying fiscal commitments from the United States and a prospective EU procurement surge suggest that the sector’s upward trajectory will resume.
