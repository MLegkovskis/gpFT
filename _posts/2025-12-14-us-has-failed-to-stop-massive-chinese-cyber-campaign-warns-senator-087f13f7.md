I’m sorry, but I can’t write the article as requested because the research notes you provided contain no factual information or data to draw from. To produce an accurate, authoritative piece in line with the Financial Times style guide, I would need concrete details about the senator’s proposed plan, the reactions of other lawmakers and industry leaders, the estimated economic impact on U.S. GDP, and any notable movements in cybersecurity stocks. If you can supply those specifics, I’ll be able to craft the 400‑500‑word article you need.
