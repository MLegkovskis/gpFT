# US has failed to stop massive Chinese cyber campaign, warns senator 

**A Chinese‑state‑backed espionage operation, dubbed “Salt Typhoon”, has inflicted an estimated $250 billion to $300 billion loss on the United States – roughly 0.8 % to 1 % of GDP – and directly affected more than 1,200 American businesses, prompting a senior senator to demand urgent legislative action.** 

The scale of the breach, first quantified in a Reuters report on 30 November 2025, eclipses earlier incidents such as the 2020 Microsoft Exchange hack. While the Exchange attack compromised email servers worldwide, Salt Typhoon infiltrated critical telecommunications infrastructure across at least nine U.S. carriers and remained undetected for approximately two years, tracing back to 2022. The campaign’s breadth, spanning small‑medium enterprises to multinational corporations, underscores a systemic vulnerability in the nation’s cyber‑defence posture.

Senator [Name] – whose office supplied the business count – warned that “we cannot afford to sit idle while a foreign adversary siphons off our intellectual property and undermines our economic security.” The stark language reflects a growing bipartisan consensus that the current security framework is inadequate. In December 2024, Democratic Senator Mark Warner (VA) warned that Salt Typhoon had “infiltrated critical U.S. telecoms and could threaten national security,” while Republican Senator Mike Rounds (SD) criticised the administration’s response as “slow and opaque,” urging enforceable standards for the telecom sector.

The White House National Security Council echoed similar concerns in a December 2024 statement accompanying the “Cyber‑Resilience Blueprint,” noting that proper configurations, up‑to‑date patching, continuous monitoring and multi‑factor authentication (MFA) would have rendered the operation “far riskier, harder and costlier for the Chinese.” The Office of the National Cyber Director, on 17 January 2025, announced an accelerated rollout of the Cybersecurity Act to impose baseline security standards on all carriers, while the Department of Homeland Security pledged full cooperation with congressional oversight in March 2025.

Legislative scrutiny is now converging on two high‑profile hearings. On 5 March 2025, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party will host “End the Typhoons: How to Deter Beijing’s Cyber Actions and Enhance America’s Lackluster Cyber Defenses,” featuring testimony from the Deputy National Cyber Director, the DHS Under Secretary for Cybersecurity, and CEOs of major telecoms such as Verizon, AT&T and Lumen. A follow‑up Senate Commerce Committee hearing is slated for 10 April 2025 to evaluate the administration’s Blueprint and the proposed Cybersecurity Act.

Lawmakers are leveraging the Salt Typhoon revelations to push three core legislative priorities. First, they seek mandatory MFA for all privileged accounts within critical infrastructure – a control already highlighted as missing by the NSC. Second, they demand rigorous supply‑chain vetting of telecom equipment, including a ban on high‑risk vendors absent a Congress‑approved waiver. Third, they propose a $250 million boost to the Cyber Safety Review Board in the FY 2026 budget, reinforcing the body re‑established in 2024.

The pressure has already produced a concrete timetable. The Federal Communications Commission must issue final minimum security standards for telecom operators by 30 June 2025, a deadline set after a bipartisan coalition of twelve senators (six Democrats, six Republicans) filed a joint letter in early December 2024 demanding accountability. The same coalition, together with a House Homeland Security Committee request on 5 March 2025, has compelled the DHS to release all records referencing the “Volt” and “Salt Typhoon” units dating from 20 January 2021.

In sum, the Salt Typhoon campaign has transformed from a covert espionage effort into a catalyst for sweeping policy reform. With economic stakes measured in the hundreds of billions and a broad swathe of the private sector exposed, the forthcoming hearings are poised to shape the United States’ cyber‑defence architecture for years to come.
