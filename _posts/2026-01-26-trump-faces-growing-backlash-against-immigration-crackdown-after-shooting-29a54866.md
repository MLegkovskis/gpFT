# Trump Faces Backlash Against Immigration Crackdown
President Trump is facing a growing backlash against his immigration crackdown after a fatal shooting in Minneapolis. The incident has sparked widespread protests and calls for investigations from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.

## Lawmaker Responses
Republican lawmakers such as Rep. Andrew Garbarino and Sen. Bill Cassidy have requested formal testimony from ICE, CBP, and USCIS heads, while others like Rep. James Comer have suggested pulling ICE agents out of Minneapolis. Democratic officials have seized on the incident to press for oversight and link the crackdown to broader election-year concerns.

## Public Opinion Shifts
A recent AP-NORC poll shows a significant shift in public opinion, with approval of Trump's immigration policy dropping 11 points in just three months. This shift in public opinion is likely to have significant implications for the upcoming election.

## Legislative Consequences
The controversy is already influencing budget negotiations, with the possibility of a partial government shutdown if Congress does not resolve funding for ICE and related agencies.
