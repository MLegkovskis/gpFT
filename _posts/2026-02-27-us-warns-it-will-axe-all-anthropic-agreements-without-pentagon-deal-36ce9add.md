# US Warns Anthropic of Agreement Termination 
 The United States has given Anthropic an ultimatum: sign a revised deal with the Pentagon by Friday, 28 Feb 2026, 5:01 pm ET, or face the termination of all agreements. 
 
 The Pentagon is demanding that Anthropic drop its internal 'red-line' safeguards, including bans on autonomous weapons and mass surveillance, and agree to 'any lawful use' of its technology. 
 
 The contract at issue is worth approximately $200 million and was signed in August 2025 for use on classified systems. 
 
 ## Demanded Deal Terms 
 - **'Any lawful use' clause**: The Pentagon wants Anthropic to agree that its technology can be used for any lawful Department of Defense purpose without Anthropic-level approval. 
 - **Removal of autonomous-weapon and mass-surveillance restrictions**: Anthropic's current policy bars its technology from being used for fully autonomous weapons and mass surveillance of US citizens. The Pentagon is demanding that these safeguards be lifted. 
 - **Unlimited, unrestricted access for the three services**: The original contract gave the Pentagon limited, vetted access to Anthropic's technology. The new demand is for 'unlimited use of its technology' across the Army, Navy, and Air Force. 
 
 ## Potential Geopolitical Implications 
 The US's decision to axe agreements with Anthropic could have significant geopolitical implications, including: 
 - **Domestic consolidation of AI-defence capability**: The US may push the market toward firms that accept 'any lawful use' clauses, reducing diversity of US AI sources and raising concentration risk. 
 - **International perception of US AI policy**: The episode underscores a tension between national-security imperatives and AI-ethics commitments, potentially slowing joint AI-research initiatives and prompting the EU to double-down on its own regulatory regime. 
 - **China's propaganda advantage**: Beijing can portray the US as forcing companies to abandon safety safeguards, bolstering its narrative that the US sacrifices responsible AI for military advantage. 
 
 ## Conclusion 
 The US's ultimatum to Anthropic has significant implications for the company, the US AI industry, and the global AI supply chain. The outcome of this situation will be closely watched by industry leaders, policymakers, and geopolitical analysts.
