The decline of private equity's pioneer in tapping retail money has significant implications for the U.S. economy and the private equity industry. With private equity's share of U.S. GDP at approximately 6.5%, any slowdown in the sector can have far-reaching consequences. The loss of edge has resulted in a contraction in assets under management, fewer buy-outs, and slower growth of portfolio companies. This, in turn, has led to a decline in retail-money inflows into semi-liquid PE funds, with a 23% YoY fundraising decline. Furthermore, 80% of institutional LPs are less likely to allocate to PE firms that take significant retail money, indicating a backlash against retail-heavy funds. The combined effect threatens both macro-economic growth and the private-equity industry's long-term fundraising pipeline.
