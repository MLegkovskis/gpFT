**Tech giants have moved roughly $120 bn of AI‑data‑centre financing off their balance sheets, prompting rating agencies to hold fire and investors to cheer, with after‑hours gains of 2‑3 % across the sector.** The manoeuvre, executed through synthetic leases and securitised “synthetic‑CLO” structures, leaves headline leverage largely untouched, allowing Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta to retain their existing credit ratings while their shares surged on the news. The broader NASDAQ‑100, heavily weighted towards these hyperscalers, rose 1.4 % on the day.

S&P Global’s December‑21 note makes clear that the $120 bn off‑balance‑sheet financing “does not materially change leverage ratios” for the four firms, leaving Amazon at AA‑, Microsoft and Alphabet at A+ and Meta at A. Moody’s echoed the sentiment a day earlier, reaffirming Amazon at A1 and assigning A1 to Microsoft, A2 to Alphabet and Meta, with no immediate credit impact. In the equity markets the reaction was uniformly positive: Bloomberg reported after‑hours jumps of 3.2 % for Amazon, 2.8 % for Microsoft, 2.5 % for Alphabet and 2.1 % for Meta, while MarketWatch noted the NASDAQ‑100’s 1.4 % lift.

The scale of the operation dwarfs the tech‑sector debt restructurings of the 2008‑09 financial crisis. Back then, distressed‑debt exchanges and covenant waivers moved roughly $30‑$40 bn off the books of firms such as Cisco, Dell and HP. By contrast, the 2025 shift involves a three‑to‑four‑fold larger sum and a markedly different toolkit. Synthetic leases allow the companies to retain tax depreciation while keeping the liability hidden from balance‑sheet metrics; the loan tranches are then sold to insurers, pension funds and other long‑term investors via securitisation. In 2008, the primary instruments were outright debt‑for‑equity swaps and outright bankruptcy filings, which transferred risk directly to equity holders.

Both episodes share the objective of preserving headline leverage, yet the risk profiles diverge. The 2025 approach pushes exposure into the structured‑finance market, creating a “synthetic” risk that regulators have warned could amplify systemic stress if AI demand falters. The 2008 restructurings, by contrast, reduced leverage on the balance sheet but often left companies with diluted equity and, in some cases, lingering credit downgrades. Indeed, rating agencies cut several tech names to “BBB‑” or “BB+” in late 2008, and new issuance from the sector fell by roughly 30 % in Q4 of that year. In the current cycle, agencies have refrained from downgrades, but their commentary underscores the novelty of the risk transfer.

The timing of the move is also noteworthy. It arrives as AI‑capacity spending peaks and lenders, wary of a “lending frenzy,” demand higher risk premiums. By the third quarter of 2025, $85 bn of the $120 bn had already been sold to institutional investors, with the remainder still being marketed. The Financial Times summed up the strategic calculus: “Creative financing helps insulate Big Tech while binding Wall Street to a future boom or bust.” The same report highlighted average leverage ratios of 2.5‑3.0 × EBITDA and quarterly cash‑burn rates of $15‑$20 bn for AI capex, underscoring the pressure to keep headline metrics tidy.

Early signs suggest the market has rewarded the engineering of balance‑sheet risk, at least in the short term. Whether the synthetic structures will prove resilient under a slowdown in AI demand remains an open question, and regulators are likely to scrutinise the growing exposure of insurers and pension funds to what is essentially corporate debt masquerading as off‑balance‑sheet assets. For now, the hyperscalers enjoy a clean credit profile and buoyant share prices, but the underlying liability has merely been repackaged, not eliminated.
