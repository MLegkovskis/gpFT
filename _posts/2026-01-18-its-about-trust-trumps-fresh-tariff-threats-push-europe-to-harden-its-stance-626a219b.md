### Trump's Tariff Threats Prompt European Unity
The recent tariff threats by US President Donald Trump against EU allies have sparked a strong, unified response from European leaders. The threats, announced on Trump's Truth-Social post on January 17, 2026, include a 10% tariff on imports from eight EU countries, effective February 1, 2026, with the potential to rise to 25% if a 'deal' on Greenland is not reached.

European leaders have swiftly condemned the move, with French President Emmanuel Macron calling it 'unacceptable' and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer describing it as 'completely wrong.' Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has pledged a united EU stance, stating that 'Europe won't be blackmailed.'

### EU Response and Diplomatic Efforts
The EU has initiated emergency diplomatic coordination, with an EU ambassadors' emergency meeting on January 17, 2026, and a European Council session on January 22, 2026. The EU is preparing to trigger its Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), which allows for proportionate counter-measures, including retaliatory duties, if a third-party uses economic pressure to achieve political aims.

Bilateral talks and diplomatic outreach are also underway, with Starmer requesting a pause on the tariffs pending 'constructive dialogue' and offering a limited concession on a joint Arctic research program. The French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs has sent a formal diplomatic note to the White House, asking for the immediate withdrawal of the tariff threat and proposing a multilateral Arctic governance framework.

### NATO's Mediating Role
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has entered the dialogue, emphasizing the security dimension of the Greenland issue and urging de-escalation. Rutte has spoken with Trump about the security situation in Greenland and the Arctic, highlighting the need for a peaceful resolution.

### Public Protests and Impact Assessments
Public protests have taken place in Nuuk, Greenland, and Copenhagen, Denmark, with demonstrators condemning the 'commercial blackmail' and demanding 'respect for sovereignty.' The EU will produce a rapid economic impact study to quantify the effect of the tariffs on key sectors and inform any counter-measure calculations.
