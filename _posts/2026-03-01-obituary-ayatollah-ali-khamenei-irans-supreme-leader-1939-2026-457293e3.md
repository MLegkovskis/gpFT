# Obituary: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader since 1989, died on March 1, 2026, at the age of 86, following a joint U.S.-Israeli airstrike that hit his Tehran office. The incident has sparked a mixture of reactions, with some celebrating his death and others mourning the loss of the country's top leader.
## Immediate Implications
The death of Khamenei creates an unprecedented succession moment for the Islamic Republic. The Assembly of Experts, an 88-member body of senior clerics, will convene to elect a new Supreme Leader. However, the process is expected to be complex, with potential candidates including both hard-line and moderate clerics.
## Domestic Implications
The power vacuum created by Khamenei's death may lead to intra-elite rivalry, with the President, Head of the Judiciary, and other high-ranking officials vying for control. The economic situation in Iran is also expected to worsen, with a potential drop in oil exports and a rise in inflation.
## Foreign Policy Implications
The event may have significant implications for Iran's relationships with other countries, particularly in the Middle East and with Western nations. The U.S. and Israel may see an opportunity to pursue a renewed nuclear deal, while a hard-line successor could intensify proxy wars in the region.
## Quotes and Reactions
* 'Khamenei, one of the most evil people in History, is dead… gives Iranians their greatest chance to take back their country.' - Donald Trump
* 'We will respond to every missile, every drone, every bullet that falls on Iranian soil. The world will hear the roar of the Islamic Revolution again.' - IRGC commander Qasem Soleimani Jalili
## Conclusion
The death of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei marks a significant turning point for Iran, with potential implications for the country's domestic and foreign policy. The next 40 days of mourning will be a critical period, as the country navigates the complex succession process and responds to the changing regional and international landscape.
