# Trump's Greenland Pivot Leaves Europe Flummoxed
## Introduction
The idea of the United States purchasing Greenland has been a topic of discussion since 2019, when President Donald Trump first expressed interest in buying the island. The proposal has been met with skepticism by European leaders, particularly Denmark, which considers the idea 'absurd'.
## Strategic Military Value
The U.S. already operates Thule Air Base, the northernmost U.S. Air Force installation, and Camp Nogales, a radar site. Control of the island would give Washington a direct foothold over the Arctic air-defence and early-warning network that Russia and China are expanding.
## Resource Competition
Melting ice has made Greenland's ~2 billion tonnes of rare-earth deposits economically viable. Controlling the island would give the U.S. a domestic source of critical minerals needed for electric-vehicle batteries, wind-turbine generators, and defense electronics, reducing reliance on China.
## Shipping-Lane Leverage
The Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage together could cut 2,000-3,000 km from the Europe-Asia trade corridor. Trump argued that U.S. ownership would let Washington regulate traffic, collect fees, and project naval power along those routes.
## Alignment with Trump's Broader Foreign-Policy Agenda
The Greenland push dovetails with Trump's 'Contain China' doctrine, which also featured proposals to re-open the Arctic Council under U.S. leadership and to expand the U.S. Navy's Arctic fleet.
## Conclusion
Trump's interest in buying Greenland is driven by a combination of strategic military value, resource competition, and shipping-lane leverage. While the proposal has been met with skepticism by European leaders, the U.S. has already begun to expand its presence in Greenland, with a $1.2 billion investment to modernize Thule Air Base.
