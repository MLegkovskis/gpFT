# Bondi Under Fire Over Handling of Epstein Files
## Congressional Hearing Addresses Conflicts of Interest and Improprieties
Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a heated 5-hour congressional hearing on February 11, 2026, over her handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The hearing, conducted by the House Judiciary Committee, tackled alleged conflicts of interest and improprieties in Bondi's handling of the case.
## Key Issues Addressed
* The redaction of alleged co-conspirators' names, such as Les Wexner, while some survivor names were left visible
* The release of a printout titled 'Jayapal Pramila Search History' that listed eight specific file numbers the Representative had queried
* The limitation of lawmakers' access to documents, with each member given a unique login to a small, phone-free room
## Bondi's Response
Bondi pledged to 'un-redact' any improperly hidden names and to re-redact any survivor names that were mistakenly released. However, she declined to apologize directly to survivors, stating she was 'deeply sorry for what any victim has been through' but would not 'get in the gutter' with Democrats.
## Outcome
The hearing ended with no formal finding of misconduct, but Bondi committed to correcting any improper redactions and further reviewing the redaction policy.
