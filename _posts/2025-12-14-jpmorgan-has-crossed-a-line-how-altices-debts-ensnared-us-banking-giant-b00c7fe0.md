**JPMorgan’s entanglement with Altice’s debt has ignited a multi‑agency review, with regulators and Capitol Hill signalling a possible overhaul of how banks combine advisory and lending roles.** The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s September 2025 guidance on “de‑banking” was drafted in direct response to the fallout, while a joint Federal Reserve‑FDIC memo dated 5 December 2025 flagged the $5 billion exposure as a textbook case of large‑loan‑concentration risk. Congressional leaders from both parties have since pressed for legislative tweaks, and chief executive Jamie Dimon has urged a sweeping re‑examination of the regulatory regime that governs “dual‑role” transactions.

The OCC’s new guidance requires examiners to probe whether banks discriminate on political or religious grounds and, crucially, to assess conflicts that arise when a bank both advises a borrower and holds a material exposure to that borrower. Regulators argue that the Altice restructuring exposed a blind spot: JPMorgan acted as adviser to the debt‑restructuring while simultaneously sitting on a $5 billion stake in Altice‑related securities. The September directive makes clear that banks must now demonstrate that any account‑termination decisions are rooted in legitimate risk‑based criteria, not extraneous considerations.

Echoing the OCC’s concerns, the Federal Reserve and FDIC released a joint memorandum on 5 December 2025 that called for “heightened supervisory scrutiny” of institutions that wear both hats. The memo stresses that the Altice episode underscores the need for a systematic review of large‑loan‑concentration risk, suggesting that the current supervisory framework may be ill‑suited to detect and mitigate conflicts of interest inherent in such arrangements.

Congressional reaction has been swift and bipartisan. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Roger Scott (R‑OH) testified on 9 December 2025, warning that regulators have “seriously over‑reached” and urging a rollback of what he described as “burdensome and arbitrary regulations.” A few days later, the House Financial Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions convened a hearing on 12 December 2025, where Representative Jenna Johnson (D‑CA) pressed the OCC for a concrete framework to evaluate advisory‑related conflicts. Both chambers signalled an appetite for legislative reform, with the prospect of new or amended bills entering the 2026 congressional session.

JPMorgan itself has not remained silent. In a regulatory filing dated 8 December 2025, the bank acknowledged that it is “responding to requests from government authorities and other external parties regarding the firm’s policies and processes related to fair access to banking.” The filing notes that several matters are at various stages, including reviews, investigations and legal proceedings. Meanwhile, Dimon, after a closed‑door meeting with Washington officials on 7 December 2025, told reporters that “it’s time, in my view, to take a step back and look at all the rules and regulations put in place.” His remarks add weight to the growing consensus that the Altice‑JPMorgan saga could catalyse a broader regulatory overhaul.

Taken together, the OCC’s September guidance, the Fed‑FDIC’s December memo, and the chorus of congressional criticism point to a formal, ongoing review rather than an isolated comment. While the precise shape of any forthcoming rule changes remains uncertain, the convergence of supervisory, legislative and industry voices makes it clear that the Altice episode will be a catalyst for tightening oversight of banks that act as both adviser and creditor. Stakeholders can expect a sustained period of scrutiny, with potential new regulations or legislation likely to emerge before the close of 2026.
