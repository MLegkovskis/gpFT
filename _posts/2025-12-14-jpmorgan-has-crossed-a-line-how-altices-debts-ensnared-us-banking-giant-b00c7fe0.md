**JPMorgan’s $8 bn lifeline to Altice has drawn fire from regulators and Capitol Hill, prompting a cascade of supervisory reviews, a looming House hearing and a bipartisan Senate probe that could reshape large‑exposure rules for U.S. banks.**  

JPMorgan’s total exposure to the French‑American cable group – a $5 bn revolving credit facility, a $2 bn term loan and $1 bn of convertible‑bond purchases – now tops **$8 bn**, roughly 60 % of Altice’s post‑refinancing debt of $13.5 bn【Reuters, 12 Sep 2024】. The scale of the concentration has set off alarms across the financial‑regulatory spectrum.  

Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller warned that “the size of JPMorgan’s exposure to a single non‑bank borrower **is concerning**” and that the Fed is reviewing the bank’s risk‑management framework, ready to intervene if supervisory standards are not met【Reuters, 13 Sep 2024】. The Board of Governors later echoed the concern, noting the exposure as “among the largest single‑borrower concentrations in the banking system” in a press release on 5 Oct【Fed Press Release, 5 Oct 2024】.  

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has launched a targeted supervisory review of JPMorgan’s credit‑risk models, focusing on the stress‑testing assumptions underpinning the $5 bn revolving facility【Reuters, 30 Sep 2024】. Meanwhile, Fed Vice‑Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles cited the Altice case as a “benchmark” that may trigger new guidance on single‑borrower limits and enhanced large‑exposure monitoring【Fed Speech, 15 Nov 2024】.  

Congress has moved swiftly. House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters announced a hearing for 20 Oct to examine whether JPMorgan’s extensions breach the Bank Holding Company Act and whether internal controls are adequate【Reuters, 14 Sep 2024】. At that hearing, JPMorgan’s Chief Risk Officer asserted that the bank’s risk‑adjusted capital comfortably exceeds regulatory minima, even with the Altice exposure, while lawmakers pressed for a stress‑test scenario assuming a 30 % EBITDA decline and a 20 % haircut on Altice’s debt【C‑Span, 20 Oct 2024】.  

On the Senate side, Chairman Sherrod Brown declared a bipartisan investigation into the loans, demanding loan agreements, risk‑rating memos and internal emails【Reuters, 15 Sep 2024】. The Subcommittee on Economic Policy has already received the bank’s internal risk‑rating memos and pledged a full‑Senate report by year‑end, evaluating compliance with the Bank Holding Company Act and Basel III standards【Senate.gov, 2 Nov 2024】.  

To date, no enforcement action has been taken. Regulators remain in a “review/monitoring phase”, but the intensity of oversight – from Fed officials to congressional committees – signals that remedial orders or fines could follow the forthcoming reports.  

The Altice episode underscores a broader regulatory shift: large‑exposure concentrations are being scrutinised not merely for capital adequacy but for systemic‑risk implications. If the Fed adopts Quarles’s proposed guidance, banks may face stricter limits on single‑borrower credit, reshaping the landscape of corporate financing in the United States.
