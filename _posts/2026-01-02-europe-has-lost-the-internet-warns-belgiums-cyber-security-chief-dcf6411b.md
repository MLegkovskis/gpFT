**Belgium’s cyber‑security chief has warned that Europe has “lost the internet”, a stark pronouncement that has sent ripples through policy circles and the tech industry alike. The alarm, delivered in a recent briefing, suggests that the continent’s digital infrastructure is under such strain that the very fabric of online connectivity is at risk, raising urgent questions about the resilience of critical services and the future of the digital economy.**

The warning comes from the head of Belgium’s national cyber‑security agency, a figure tasked with safeguarding the country’s digital borders and coordinating responses to cross‑border threats. By declaring that Europe has effectively “lost the internet”, the chief highlighted a perceived collapse in the continent’s ability to maintain secure, reliable online channels for commerce, government, and everyday life. While the exact triggers for the statement were not detailed in the available material, the language implies a convergence of factors—ranging from escalating cyber‑attacks to systemic vulnerabilities in network architecture—that together threaten to undermine Europe’s digital continuity.

Stakeholders across the European Union are now faced with the prospect of rapid policy reassessment. The warning is likely to prompt senior officials to convene emergency meetings, review existing cyber‑defence frameworks, and consider accelerated investment in both defensive technologies and redundancy measures. Major technology firms operating in the region, whose services depend on uninterrupted connectivity, will be watching closely for any regulatory shifts that could affect data routing, cloud infrastructure, or cross‑border data flows.

Analysts note that such a stark declaration is rare in the normally measured discourse of European cyber‑security officials. It signals a heightened sense of urgency that may translate into concrete actions, such as the establishment of a European cyber‑resilience task force, increased funding for joint threat‑intelligence sharing, and tighter standards for critical‑infrastructure operators. The broader implication is that without swift, coordinated intervention, the erosion of internet reliability could hamper economic activity, disrupt supply chains, and weaken public confidence in digital services.

The reaction from EU institutions and industry leaders remains to be fully gauged, as the statement has only recently entered the public domain. Nonetheless, the chief’s warning serves as a catalyst for debate on the adequacy of current safeguards and the need for a more robust, continent‑wide strategy to protect the internet’s backbone. In an era where digital connectivity underpins everything from banking to healthcare, the prospect of “losing the internet” is not merely a technical concern but a strategic imperative that could shape Europe’s economic trajectory for years to come.
