**Japan’s economy in 2025 shows modest growth, low unemployment and a tentative shift away from the ultra‑easy monetary stance that characterised the “Lost Decade”, but the shadow of the 1990s bubble still looms in the nation’s towering public debt and lingering fiscal deficits.** 

Real‑GDP growth is forecast at +0.7 % for the calendar year 2025, with the government’s own estimate for FY2025 at +0.4 %. Inflation has moved into positive territory, with core‑CPI running at 2.5 % year‑on‑year in December 2025 – a stark reversal from the deflationary average of –0.5 % that plagued the 1990s. The labour market is tighter than it was a decade ago, with unemployment at 2.5 % in December 2025, well below the 5 % peak recorded in October 1999. 

The most immediate sign of a slowdown is the third‑quarter 2025 GDP figure, which contracted by 0.6 % on a quarter‑on‑quarter basis, a swing from the modest 0.4 % expansion recorded in the same quarter of 2024. This reversal highlights the fragility of domestic demand and suggests that the modest recovery may be losing momentum. 

Equity markets have recovered far beyond the depths of the early‑1990s crash. The Nikkei‑225 sits around 31,000 in December 2025 – roughly 80 % of its 1989 peak of 38,915 – whereas the index fell to about 14,500 in October 1995, a 50 % collapse. Commercial‑land prices, which surged more than three‑fold in the late 1980s, have now stabilised, showing no sign of the speculative excess that triggered the bubble. 

Bank balance sheets have also improved markedly. Non‑performing loans have fallen to about 3.2 % of total bank loans, down from a peak of roughly 8 % in FY1999. The banking sector, once on the brink of crisis, is now well‑capitalised, although legacy bad loans still linger. 

Fiscal pressures, however, have intensified. The primary balance for FY2025 is a deficit of 7.5 % of GDP, deeper than the 5.5 % shortfall recorded in FY1999. Public debt now exceeds 250 % of GDP, reflecting the cumulative impact of an ageing population and expanded social‑security spending. While the government is pursuing a deliberately expansionary stance to sustain the modest recovery, the debt burden remains a long‑term concern. 

Monetary policy is at a crossroads. The Bank of Japan’s policy rate remains slightly negative at –0.1 %, but the central bank has signalled its first rate hike in 2025, ending a 17‑year era of ultra‑easy policy. The shift is driven by the emergence of inflation around the 2‑2.5 % target range, a reversal of the deflationary spiral that forced the BOJ into near‑zero rates in the 1990s. 

Overall, Japan’s present financial picture is far less volatile than the bubble‑burst era. Growth is modest but positive, inflation has returned, equity markets have largely recovered, and banks are on firmer footing. Yet the economy still wrestles with an ageing demographic, a soaring debt load and a fiscal deficit that exceeds pre‑2000 levels. The coming months will test whether the BOJ’s tentative tightening can anchor inflation without triggering a deeper slowdown, and whether fiscal policy can balance stimulus with sustainability. 

**In short, Japan has escaped the worst of the “Lost Decade” but remains perched on a delicate balance between modest recovery and structural headwinds.**
