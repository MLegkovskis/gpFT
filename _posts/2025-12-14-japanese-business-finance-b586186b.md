**Japan’s economy slipped into a 0.6 % quarterly contraction in Q3 2025, reversing a modest 1.2 % annualised expansion recorded a year earlier – a swing of 3.5 percentage points that marks the first decline since Q1 2024 and deepens concerns over the country’s lingering “Lost‑Decade” malaise.**【Trading Economics】  

The Cabinet Office’s final figures, released on 7 December 2025, show real GDP falling 0.60 % q/q, equating to a –2.30 % annualised rate【Trading Economics – Annualised】. By contrast, the revised Q3 2024 estimate indicated a +1.2 % annualised gain, implying roughly a +0.3 % q/q rise【Nova Scotia Dept. of Finance】. The reversal is driven chiefly by weaker business spending (‑0.2 % q/q) and a sharp fall in exports (‑1.2 % q/q), while private consumption and government outlays barely nudged up (+0.2 % each) and fell short of expectations【Trading Economics】.

The contraction cannot be viewed in isolation. It echoes structural legacies of the early‑1990s asset‑price bubble, when the Nikkei 225 collapsed from 38,915 in December 1989 to around 7,600 in 1992 – an 80 % plunge, while land values fell 60 %【Wikipedia – Lost Decades】. The ensuing “balance‑sheet recession” left a cadre of zombie banks and firms that have kept investment muted for three decades. Today, Japan’s public‑debt ratio sits near 250 % of GDP, a direct outgrowth of the post‑bubble bail‑outs and stimulus programmes【DW】, and the BOJ remains entrenched in ultra‑easy policy – a negative policy rate of –0.1 % and massive QQE – to combat the liquidity trap that originated in the 1990s【Wikipedia – Lost Decades】.

Stakeholder sentiment underscores the precarious balance. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, speaking in December 2025, noted that real GDP grew 0.5 % q/q (2.2 % annualised) in the April‑June quarter, but warned that “risks to activity are skewed to the downside” as overseas slowdown and U.S. tariffs compress manufacturing margins【BOJ PDF】. In a November parliamentary appearance he added that a weak yen could revive import‑price inflation, prompting the central bank to stay ready to raise rates if wage growth sustains around 5 %【CNBC】.  

Corporate leaders echo a cautious optimism. Nissui’s CEO Teru Tanaka highlighted “moderate growth” supported by inbound tourism and a tightening employment‑income environment, keeping FY 2025 revenue and profit targets intact【SeafoodSource】. Yet surveys reveal anxiety: 71 % of CEOs expect to raise wages by roughly 5 % in FY 2026, while 64 % believe their firms would be non‑viable in a decade without structural reforms【Keidanren】; a PwC poll found the same proportion doubting long‑term viability【PwC】.  

Despite the gloom, capital‑spending data points to a resurgence of investment. The BOJ reports a 10.3 % y/y rise in business‑fixed investment in FY 2025, and a Bank of America survey shows 21.6 % growth in domestic capex plans for FY 2024, focused on semiconductors, EV electrification and digitalisation【BofA】. Shareholder‑return policies are also shifting, with record ¥10 trn share‑buybacks and ¥16 trn dividends in FY 2024, signalling a move away from cash hoarding【Kiplinger】.  

In sum, Japan’s latest GDP contraction is a symptom of deep‑seated structural constraints forged in the 1990s bubble burst. While modest growth and rising corporate investment offer a glimmer of recovery, the combination of high debt, demographic decline and a fragile external environment keeps policymakers walking a tightrope between stimulus and the first steps toward monetary normalisation.
