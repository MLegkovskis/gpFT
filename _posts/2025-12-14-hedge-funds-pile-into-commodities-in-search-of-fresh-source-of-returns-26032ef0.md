**Hedge funds are turning to commodities as a fresh source of return, with Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio now earmarking 10 % of capital for the asset class and a wave of relative‑value trades reshaping the sector.**  The shift reflects sticky inflation, negative real yields and a search for uncorrelated performance, even as oil‑price sceptics such as Carl Icahn warn of a near‑term correction in crude markets【Bloomberg 2024‑02‑22】.

Dalio’s “All‑Weather” model has doubled its commodity weight from 5 % in 2020 to 10 % today, underpinned by a 4‑6 % annualised return target for a diversified basket【Bloomberg 2024‑02‑22】.  In Bridgewater’s Q4 2023 quarterly letter the firm projected a 3‑5 % year‑on‑year rise in the commodity price index through 2025, translating into a 0.8‑1.2 % contribution to overall portfolio return in 2024【Bridgewater 2023‑Q4】.  A March 15 Reuters interview reinforced the thesis, suggesting commodities could deliver 5‑7 % nominal returns in 2024‑25, outpacing the 2‑3 % equity outlook and offering an excess return of roughly 3 %【Reuters 2024‑03‑15】.

By contrast, Icahn’s outlook is decidedly bearish on crude oil.  He predicts a 10‑15 % decline in Brent over the next three to six months unless a geopolitical shock or supply cut materialises, citing an oversupply of 2‑3 million barrels per day and recent inventory builds of 4.2 % week‑over‑week【CNBC 2024‑06‑12】【Reuters 2024‑06‑13】.  Icahn does acknowledge that AI‑driven data‑centre demand will keep electricity consumption high, but argues this will not be enough to lift oil prices without a supply shock【Bloomberg 2024‑05‑28】.

The broader hedge‑fund landscape mirrors these divergent views.  Investor sentiment towards commodity strategies has turned positive in Q2 2024, with commodity‑focused CTAs such as Statar Capital expanding AUM by 23 % to US $3.5 bn【Rupak Ghose 2024】.  Yet managers are deliberately avoiding pure trend‑following bets, favouring relative‑value and tactical trades that exploit structural demand from decarbonisation and electrification rather than speculative price spikes【Franklin Templeton 2024】.  This disciplined approach is a direct response to the 2008 financial‑crisis episode, when commodity‑index inflows surged from US $70 bn to US $235 bn, only to collapse as crude prices fell 53 % between July and October 2008【Hedge Fund Journal 2008】.  The crisis taught that massive investment‑driven inflows can create bubbles, and that a liquidity crunch—when banks withdraw hedging capacity—can turn a boom into a bust【Fed 2025】.

Today's hedge funds have internalised those lessons.  They maintain tighter risk limits, monitor margin pressures in real time, and stress‑test for correlation spikes that once saw commodities move in lock‑step with equities during the GFC【Fed 2025】.  By anchoring positions to long‑term structural trends—such as the electrification of AI data centres and the demand for copper and silver in renewable energy—managers aim to capture modest, low‑correlation returns without exposing portfolios to the volatility that characterised the 2008 commodity rally.

In sum, while Dalio’s macro‑model treats commodities as a core, medium‑term return engine, Icahn’s short‑term oil outlook underscores the need for nuanced, sector‑specific positioning.  The current environment offers a measured, risk‑aware path to commodity exposure, markedly different from the unchecked inflows and liquidity shocks of the 2008 crisis.
