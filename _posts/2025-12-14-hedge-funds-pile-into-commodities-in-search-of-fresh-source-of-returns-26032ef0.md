**Hedge funds are once again turning to commodities as a source of uncorrelated returns, with exposure to the Bloomberg Commodity Index rising 23 % year‑over‑year in the third quarter of 2025 – the strongest quarterly gain since 2013.** The surge comes against a backdrop of falling prices, modest volatility and a search for inflation‑linked performance as equity markets remain jittery. While the present environment differs markedly from the boom‑bust cycle of 2008, the lessons of that era remain a cautionary guide for today’s fund managers.

The World Bank’s October 2025 Commodity Markets Outlook projects a 7 % decline in overall commodity prices for both 2025 and 2026, the lowest level in six years. Energy prices have barely moved – the energy index slipped 0.4 % in November 2025, with European natural‑gas down 4.3 % and Australian coal up 4.7 %. Food prices are the lone bright spot, up 2.4 % year‑to‑date, while metals and precious metals have posted modest gains of 0.5 % and 0.9 % respectively. The drivers are weak global growth – the IMF forecasts just 2.1 % real GDP growth for 2025‑26 – a growing oil surplus that has lifted global crude inventories by 12 % year‑on‑year, and lingering policy uncertainty around fiscal stimulus and climate‑transition regulations.

By contrast, the 2008 Global Financial Crisis saw commodity prices swing dramatically. Crude oil doubled between June 2007 and June 2008 before collapsing 53 % between July and October 2008, returning to pre‑boom levels. Commodity‑index assets swelled from US$70 bn at the end of 2006 to US$235 bn by April 2008 – a 235 % increase in under two years – and inflows into commodity indices peaked at US$50‑60 bn in the first half of 2008. Gold and silver reached historic highs, while a rapid US‑dollar depreciation amplified the rally. When the credit crunch hit, liquidity evaporated, BCOM volatility spiked above 30 % and the United States incurred more than US$110 bn in commodity‑related losses.

Today's market is far more subdued. BCOM volatility sits at roughly 15 % annualised, and credit remains tight but market‑making in ETFs and futures stays robust. Hedge‑fund inflows into commodity‑focused funds added $12.3 bn in Q3 2025 – a 38 % year‑over‑year rise – with oil‑related strategies attracting $5.8 bn, agriculture $2.1 bn and industrial metals $1.9 bn. The liquidity environment, while constrained, does not exhibit the sudden freeze that characterised late‑2008.

The historical record offers five key take‑aways. First, speculative inflows can magnify price moves; the 2008 surge from $70 bn to $235 bn in commodity‑index assets demonstrates how quickly capital can overheat a market. Second, liquidity can disappear fast, so funds should stress‑test positions against sharp credit‑tightening scenarios. Third, currency dynamics matter – the 2008 dollar depreciation helped fuel the rally, whereas the dollar is now stable to modestly stronger, limiting currency‑driven upside. Fourth, diversification can become a double‑edged sword; allocating a large share of capital to commodities amplified the 2008 bubble, underscoring the need for risk‑parity sizing and dynamic hedging. Fifth, policy and climate risk now sit at the centre of commodity pricing, a factor absent from the 2008 playbook and one that demands scenario analysis of carbon‑price pathways.

Prominent managers echo the renewed interest. Ray Dalio, in a February 2024 Reuters interview, noted that commodities contributed roughly 4 % of Bridgewater’s net return in 2024 and form a core component of the All‑Weather risk‑parity framework, which allocates 7.5 % to commodities and underpins the ALLW ETF launched in March 2025 with a 20 % commodity exposure. Carl Icahn, speaking to Barron’s in June 2024, argued that energy commodities offer the “real upside” as inflation‑driven price surges return, a view reinforced by his firm’s $2.2 bn stake in CVR Energy and the energy segment’s 12 % contribution to Icahn Enterprises’ earnings in Q3 2025.

The bottom line is clear: 2025‑26 presents a downward‑biased, moderate‑volatility commodity market, far removed from the 2008 boom‑bust cycle. Yet the same forces that once turned a profitable rally into a costly bust – rapid inflows, credit tightening and currency swings – remain relevant. Hedge funds seeking fresh returns must therefore blend position sizing, liquidity buffers and macro‑scenario testing, while accounting for the new layer of regulatory and climate risk that now shapes commodity pricing.
