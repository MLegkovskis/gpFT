**More than 9 million U.S. borrowers are now 30 days or more behind on their student‑loan repayments, a surge that has prompted the Education Department to restart collections for the first time since March 2020 and to roll out a $2 billion assistance programme aimed at averting a looming “default cliff.”** 

The scale of the problem is stark. As of the end of June 2025, 5.3 million borrowers – representing roughly $117 billion of debt – were in default, while a further 4.3 million borrowers, accounting for about $103 billion, were 181‑270 days delinquent. The total outstanding federal student‑loan balance now stands at $1.75 trillion, more than double the stock in 2008. 

Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, appointed in April 2025, has moved swiftly. A May 5 2025 press release announced the resumption of collections on the defaulted federal‑loan portfolio, coupled with a nationwide outreach campaign that includes a multilingual hotline, a new online portal and a mandatory 30‑day notice before any borrower is shifted from an Income‑Driven Repayment (IDR) plan to a standard schedule. In partnership with the Treasury, the Department will fund a $2 billion “re‑entry assistance” grant to help borrowers who missed IDR recertifications, an initiative expected to aid roughly 1.2 million individuals. 

The policy response is being reinforced by other officials. Under‑Secretary Nicholas Kent has voiced support for the May 2025 collection restart and called for legislative clarification that places loan‑forgiveness authority squarely with the Education Department rather than the courts. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, led by Director Ruth Miller, has launched 30 enforcement actions against servicers that failed to provide accurate repayment‑plan information, signalling a tougher regulatory stance on borrower protection. 

Congressional pressure is mounting. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, together with over 40 bipartisan colleagues, sent a July 15 2025 letter demanding a reversal of the interest‑rate hike on SAVE‑forbearance borrowers and urging an immediate halt to any cost‑increasing measures. Their October 15 2025 joint letter called for a $15 billion emergency relief package to cover missed payments incurred during the post‑pause period (October 2023‑March 2024). The House Committee on Education & Labor, chaired by Rep. Judy Chu, ordered weekly delinquency dashboards from the Department and a comprehensive impact report on the collection restart by the end of December 2025. 

The current crisis eclipses the student‑loan distress of the Great Recession. In 2008‑09, the cohort default rate peaked at 7 percent and 90‑plus‑day delinquency hovered around 8.5 percent of balances. Today, 20.5 percent of borrowers with a payment due are 90 days or more delinquent, and roughly 34 percent of those with an active payment are 30 plus days behind. In raw numbers, the present 9 million 30‑plus‑day delinquents dwarf the roughly 5 million borrowers who were late in 2008, while the dollar value of unpaid debt has more than doubled. The trigger this time is the expiration of pandemic‑era forbearance and the removal of the “on‑ramp” that had delayed credit‑bureau reporting, a shock not present during the housing‑market collapse of 2008. 

The combined effort of the Education Department, Treasury, CFPB and a Congress increasingly attuned to borrower hardship aims to blunt the projected default cliff before it translates into a broader financial shock. Whether the $2 billion assistance grant and intensified outreach can stem the tide remains to be seen, but the policy momentum marks a decisive shift from the more hands‑off approach of the previous decade.
