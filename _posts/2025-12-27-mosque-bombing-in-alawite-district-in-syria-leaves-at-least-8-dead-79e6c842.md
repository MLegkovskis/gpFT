**A bomb exploded inside the Imam Ali bin Abi Talib Mosque in Homs on Friday, killing at least eight worshippers and wounding roughly eighteen others, officials said.** The attack struck during the Friday prayer service in the Wadi al‑Dhahab neighbourhood, a district of the Syrian city of Homs that is predominantly Alawite. Syrian state news agency SANA confirmed the death toll, while the Health Ministry’s Najib al‑Naasan gave the figure for the injured.

The blast, which occurred on 26 December 2025, has been reported by a range of international news outlets. Reuters described the incident as a “bomb explosion at the Imam Ali bin Abi Talib mosque during Friday prayers,” echoing SANA’s statement that eight people were killed. Euronews and PBS NewsHour both cited the same casualty numbers, noting that the explosion left eighteen people with injuries ranging from minor wounds to more serious trauma. CBS News also reported the same figures, underscoring a consensus among sources on the scale of the tragedy.

The mosque targeted is a place of worship for the Alawite minority, a sect that has traditionally been aligned with the Syrian government. While the motive behind the bombing remains unclear, the choice of a religious site during the most sacred weekly gathering has amplified the shock across the country. The attack comes at a time when Syria continues to grapple with the lingering effects of a decade‑long civil war, and any violence that touches a minority community risks inflaming sectarian sensitivities.

Syrian authorities have not yet identified the perpetrators, and no group has claimed responsibility. The government’s immediate response has been limited to the factual reporting of casualties, with SANA and the Health Ministry providing the only official statements to date. International reaction has been muted in the early hours following the blast, as diplomatic channels assess the potential ramifications for regional stability.

Analysts note that attacks on places of worship can have a disproportionate impact on communal cohesion, especially in a city like Homs where sectarian lines have historically been a flashpoint. The targeting of an Alawite mosque may be intended to send a broader message, but without a claim of responsibility, the strategic intent remains speculative. Observers will be watching closely for any subsequent statements from Syrian security forces or from opposition factions that could shed light on the perpetrators.

The incident adds another tragic chapter to Syria’s ongoing cycle of violence, reminding the international community that even as large‑scale battles have receded, the threat of localized attacks persists. The death of eight worshippers and the injury of eighteen more underscores the fragile security environment that continues to affect civilians across the country.
