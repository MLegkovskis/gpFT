**Venezuela’s economy teeters on the brink after the United States seized President Nicolás Maduro, with a further 8‑12 % GDP contraction looming on top of a 75 % decline since 2014.** The U.S. blockade, which is expected to shut down more than 70 % of Venezuelan oil output this year, has stripped the regime of its chief source of public revenue – roughly 40 % of the state budget – and accelerated a spiral of hyper‑inflation, fiscal deficit and humanitarian distress.

The loss of oil earnings translates into an estimated US $5‑6 billion per month evaporating from the treasury. With the Ministry of Finance forecasting a 12 % of‑GDP deficit for 2026, the government is resorting to emergency borrowing from allies such as Russia, China and Iran, and to aggressive money‑printing that fuels an inflation rate of about 1 200 % this year. The International Monetary Fund’s special article projects a 9 % real‑GDP drop for 2026, split between a 4 % hit from the oil shutdown, a 3 % collapse in ancillary industries and a 2 % reduction in public consumption as subsidies evaporate.

The human cost is already evident. More than 80 % of the 28 million residents face food insecurity, and the UN‑DP estimates that an additional 2.5 million people will slip into extreme poverty in 2026. Migration pressures have surged, with roughly 150 000 Venezuelans leaving in the first quarter of the year, adding to a cumulative exodus of eight million since 2014. Unemployment hovers around 30 % officially, while the informal sector swallows over 70 % of the labour force.

Financial markets reacted with a mixture of caution and opportunism. Overnight Brent slipped to about $60 a barrel on 3 January, but rebounded to $61.50 at the opening of 4 January as investors priced in a possible short‑term supply bump if U.S. firms take over Venezuelan fields. U.S. crude (WTI) followed a similar pattern, falling below $58 before climbing to $58.13. Oil‑service companies such as Schlumberger and Halliburton surged more than 10 % in intraday trading, while integrated majors Chevron and ExxonMobil rose 5 % and 2 % respectively, reflecting speculation that U.S. firms could win future contracts once sanctions ease. By contrast, Canadian heavy‑crude producers like Cenovus fell about 4 % as investors reassessed the viability of Venezuelan supply. Safe‑haven assets rallied sharply; gold jumped 1.9 % to $4 424 an ounce and silver rose 5.7 %, underscoring heightened geopolitical risk.

Regional leaders have uniformly condemned the U.S. action. Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva warned that the intervention threatens the region’s peace and called for dialogue, while Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro denounced the raid as a breach of sovereignty that would deepen the humanitarian crisis and fuel migration. Colombia’s foreign minister, Álvaro Uribe, pledged cooperation to monitor security and assist refugees, and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro dismissed the operation as an attempt to control sovereign oil resources.

The broader outlook remains bleak. Moody’s placed Venezuela on a Caa3 rating with a negative outlook, citing the seizure and ensuing oil blockade as catalysts for a further sovereign‑debt default. Foreign direct investment is projected to tumble below US $100 million for 2026, a stark drop from the US $1.2 billion recorded in 2023. With fiscal coffers drained, inflation soaring and the majority of the population facing hunger, the regime’s capacity to stabilise the economy appears severely constrained.

**Bottom line:** The U.S. capture of Maduro has deepened an already catastrophic economic collapse, adding an estimated 8‑12 % GDP contraction to a decade‑long 75 % decline, choking off oil revenues, inflating prices, and pushing millions further into poverty, while prompting a mixed market response and regional diplomatic outcry.
