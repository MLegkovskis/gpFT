# Ford-Xiaomi EV Partnership: Potential Impact on GDP, Jobs, and Investment
## Introduction
Ford and Xiaomi have been reported to have held preliminary talks about a joint-venture to build electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States. Although both companies have denied the reports, this article explores the potential impact of such a partnership on GDP, jobs, and investment.
## Potential Impact
A potential partnership between Ford and Xiaomi could lead to a significant investment in the EV sector. Based on Ford's historic EV plant spend and Xiaomi's EV budget, the total joint-venture investment could be in the range of $2-3 billion. This investment could create approximately 5,000 direct U.S. jobs and 12,000-15,000 indirect jobs in the supply chain and services sector.
## GDP Contribution
The total GDP contribution of the partnership could be around $6-11 billion across the United States and China over the first five years. This estimate is based on the World Bank's economic multipliers of manufacturing investment, which suggest that every $1 billion of direct EV-plant investment in a high-income economy typically yields $2.5-3.0 billion of total GDP impact over five years.
## Conclusion
While the talks between Ford and Xiaomi have been denied, a potential partnership could have a significant impact on the EV sector, creating jobs and contributing to GDP growth in both the United States and China.
