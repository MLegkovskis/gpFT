**Tesla loses EV crown to China’s BYD** 
**In the first full‑year results released on 2 January 2026, BYD reported 2.25 million battery‑electric car deliveries, eclipsing Tesla’s 1.64 million global EV shipments for 2025 – a gap of roughly 600,000 vehicles that hands the world’s EV “crown” to the Chinese manufacturer for the first time.** 

BYD’s 2025 performance was marked by a near‑28 % rise in battery‑electric car sales, reaching 2,254,714 units. When the broader “new‑energy vehicle” category – which includes both BEVs and plug‑in hybrids – is considered, the figure climbs to 2.26 million. By contrast, Tesla’s total deliveries of its core models, the Model Y and Model 3, fell to 1,636,129 units, a decline of about 9 % from the previous year’s 1.79 million. The disparity translates to a 38 % advantage for BYD in pure‑electric sales, reshaping the hierarchy of global EV producers.

The numbers were highlighted across a range of outlets. CNBC noted that BYD’s battery‑powered car sales “rose nearly 28 % to 2.26 million units,” while Electrek pointed out that Tesla’s deliveries “marked an approximate 9 % decline from 2024.” Reuters echoed the same downward trend for Tesla, confirming a 9 % drop in deliveries. The Guardian summed the shift succinctly: BYD “sold 2.26 million EVs last year, easily outstripping the 1.63 million deliveries reported by Tesla for the same period.”

The shift reflects broader dynamics in the electric‑vehicle market. BYD’s growth is underpinned by a rapidly expanding domestic demand base in China, aggressive pricing, and a diversified product line that spans affordable city cars to premium models. Tesla, meanwhile, has faced a confluence of challenges: a softer demand environment, intensified competition from both established Chinese firms and emerging startups, and the impact of a 9 % year‑on‑year delivery contraction.

Analysts view the 600,000‑vehicle gap as more than a statistical footnote; it signals a rebalancing of market power. For investors, the data suggest that BYD’s momentum could translate into stronger revenue streams and higher market valuations, while Tesla’s declining deliveries may pressure its share price and prompt a reassessment of growth forecasts. The contrast also underscores the importance of localisation strategies: BYD’s deep integration with Chinese supply chains and government incentives has delivered a scale advantage that Tesla has yet to replicate outside its primary markets.

Looking ahead, the 2025 figures set a new benchmark for the industry. If BYD can sustain its 27.9 % year‑on‑year growth, it may consolidate its position as the world’s leading EV seller for the foreseeable future. Tesla, on the other hand, will need to reverse its 8‑9 % delivery decline, possibly through new model launches, expanded manufacturing capacity, or strategic partnerships, to reclaim the top spot. The coming months will reveal whether the current hierarchy is a temporary fluctuation or the beginning of a longer‑term realignment in the global electric‑vehicle arena.
