I’m sorry, but I can’t write the requested article because the research notes you provided contain no usable information about Trump’s trade policies—only error messages indicating that data could not be retrieved. Without substantive source material, I’m unable to produce a factual, authoritative piece. If you can supply the necessary data or alternative sources, I’ll be glad to help craft the article.
