# Court Decision to Impact Bankers' Job Security and Benefits
A pending court decision will determine whether bankers can be fired for demanding sleep, potentially altering the job security and benefits packages of bankers in the industry.
## Potential Impact on Job Security and Benefits
The court's ruling could lead to significant changes in the banking industry, including:
* Formal accommodation policies for sleep-related disabilities
* Expanded disability-benefit coverage, such as mental-health counseling and sleep-disorder treatment
* Reduced mandatory on-call hours, with potential industry-wide caps at 70-80 hours per week
## Estimated Financial Impact
If firms adopt a hard-stop policy, they may need to hire approximately 10% more junior staff to cover the same deal flow, with an estimated additional cost of $5,000 to $10,000 per employee.
## Recruitment Implications
Firms that publicly adopt sleep-accommodation policies could see a 15-20% increase in applications from Gen-Z candidates, while those that resist may face higher turnover rates.
## Litigation Risk
A plaintiff victory would set a precedent that sleep-related disability is a reasonable accommodation, potentially exposing approximately 200 US investment banks to similar suits.
