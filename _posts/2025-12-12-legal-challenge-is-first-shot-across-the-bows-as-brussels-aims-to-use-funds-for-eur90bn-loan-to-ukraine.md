**Brussels’ €90bn “reparations loan” for Ukraine meets its first legal hurdle, as Belgium threatens to block the use of frozen Russian assets.**  

The European Commission has unveiled a plan to channel roughly €90 billion – two‑thirds of Kyiv’s projected 2025‑26 financing needs – into a loan backed by Russian state assets immobilised in the EU after the invasion of Ukraine. The proposal, described by the Commission as a “reparations loan”, would draw on about €210 billion of frozen Russian wealth, of which €185 billion sits in the Euroclear clearing house in Brussels.

## Legal challenge from Belgium  

Belgium, which hosts Euroclear and holds the bulk of the frozen assets, has lodged the first formal objection. In a statement, Belgian Finance Minister Vincent Van Peteghem warned that the scheme “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks” and could leave Belgium liable if the funds are later reclaimed by Moscow. The Belgian government has asked for a legally binding safeguard that would prevent any retroactive repayment to Russia and protect Euroclear’s reputation.

## EU’s response and legal fix  

In reaction, the Commission has drafted a “legal fix” – a multilateral framework that would bind all 27 member states to share any potential liability and shield Euroclear from direct lawsuits. The text, still under negotiation, is slated for presentation at the European Council summit scheduled for early December, where leaders will decide whether to invoke Article 122 of the EU treaties to keep the assets frozen under an “immediate threat” clause.

## Implications for Kyiv  

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has welcomed the loan, calling it “only fair” that Russia’s frozen wealth be used to rebuild what the war has destroyed. The €90 billion would fund military procurement, energy reconstruction and basic public services, covering roughly two‑thirds of the €130 billion Ukraine expects to need through 2026.

## Next steps  

If the legal safeguards satisfy Belgium, the Commission aims to finalise the loan agreement by the end of the month. Should Belgium maintain its opposition, the EU may have to explore alternative financing, such as issuing new bonds or seeking additional contributions from member states. The outcome will shape the EU’s ability to sustain its largest single‑country aid package since the war began.
