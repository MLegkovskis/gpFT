**Brussels’ €90bn Ukraine loan hits its first legal roadblock as Belgium warns of “unacceptable” risks**  

The European Commission’s bid to turn frozen Russian sovereign assets into a €90 billion “reparations loan” for Kyiv has run into its first formal opposition – a legal challenge spearheaded by Belgium, which fears the scheme could expose the EU to costly litigation and force it to return the funds if sanctions are later lifted.

## The EU’s financing plan  

- **Asset pool:** Roughly €210 billion of Russian state assets are immobilised in the EU, of which €185 billion sit in the Brussels‑based clearing house Euroclear.  
- **Loan proposal:** The Commission intends to lend €90 billion to Ukraine over the next two years, covering about two‑thirds of Kyiv’s projected financing gap for defence, reconstruction and basic services.  
- **Legal basis:** EU ambassadors plan to invoke Article 122 of the EU treaties – an emergency clause that allows assets to remain frozen as long as an “immediate threat to the economic interests of the Union” persists.

## Belgium’s legal objection  

Belgium, the member state that hosts Euroclear, has lodged a formal objection, arguing that the proposal “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks” that the Commission has not addressed. Prime Minister Bart De Wever warned that a single pro‑Russian EU member could veto the sanctions regime, potentially obliging Belgium to return the immobilised funds to Moscow. He also cautioned that Euroclear could face lawsuits if Russia challenges the use of its assets.

## Commission’s response  

In a bid to defuse the impasse, the Commission is drafting a “legal fix” that would shield Belgium – and by extension Euroclear – from liability should the loan be contested. A detailed framework is expected to be tabled at the European Council summit later this month.

## What comes next  

If the legal safeguards satisfy Belgium, EU leaders could move forward with the loan at the summit, using the emergency clause to keep the assets frozen while the funds are channelled to Kyiv. Failure to reach consensus could stall the €90 billion package, leaving Ukraine to seek alternative financing as Western military aid wanes.  

The outcome will test the EU’s ability to marshal frozen assets for foreign‑policy goals while navigating the complex legal terrain of sovereign‑state property rights.
