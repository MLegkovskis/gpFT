### EU-US Tensions Escalate Over Greenland and Tech
The European Union and the United States are locked in a deepening dispute over issues ranging from the sovereignty of Greenland to the regulation of big tech companies. French President Emmanuel Macron has warned of a 'geopolitical battle' against US pressure, emphasizing the need for the EU to defend its digital regulations, including the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

### Tech Regulation at the Forefront
The DSA and DMA are central to the EU's efforts to regulate online platforms and promote digital market competition. These laws could impose significant fines on non-compliant companies, up to 10% of their global turnover. The US has criticized these regulations, threatening retaliation, including potential sanctions against European AI firms like France's Mistral.

### Greenland Dispute: A Strategic Flashpoint
The Greenland issue has become a strategic flashpoint, with the US expressing interest in the island's resources and the EU viewing this as a challenge to European sovereignty. Macron has framed the situation as a 'wake-up call' for Europe, necessitating a unified response to assert European sovereignty and protect against US coercion.

### EU's Role in Resolving Tensions
Macron believes the EU should play a proactive role in mediating and resolving these tensions. He advocates for the EU to act as a mediator between Denmark/Greenland and the US, provide concrete support to Greenland, and defend the rules-based international order. The EU should also be ready to use its economic levers, including the anti-coercion trade mechanism, to counter US pressure.

### Conclusion
The EU-US tensions over Greenland and tech represent a significant challenge to the transatlantic relationship. Macron's stance reflects the EU's determination to defend its sovereignty, regulatory autonomy, and the rules-based order. As these tensions continue to evolve, the EU's ability to navigate this complex geopolitical landscape will be crucial.
