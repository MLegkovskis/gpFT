**Jamie Lee Curtis, the Oscar‑winning actress celebrated for her range from horror icon to comedy stalwart, says her greatest asset is a “joy of life” that sustains her through a 55‑year career and a personal life marked by long‑term partnership and adoption.** In a candid interview published on 1 September 2024, the 64‑year‑old star reflected on how gratitude, routine and a willingness to embrace the ordinary have become the backbone of her creative resilience and public‑spokenness on mental‑health issues.

## Joy as a Professional Compass  
Curtis, who earned a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for *Everything Everywhere All at Once* (2022), explained that the “gift” of joy informs her choice of projects. She cited the 2024 thriller *A Quiet Place: Day One*—her first lead role in a franchise—as an example of a script that balanced tension with moments of levity, allowing her to “laugh even while the world is on fire.” The film opened in the United States on 31 May 2024, grossing US$45 million in its opening weekend, a figure Curtis described as “a pleasant surprise for a genre piece.”

## Personal Foundations  
Married to actor‑director Christopher Guest since 23 December 1984, the couple have adopted two children, Annie (born 1990) and Thomas (born 1993). Curtis highlighted that the stability of a 40‑year marriage and the routine of family life—dinners at 7 p.m., weekend walks in the Santa Monica hills—anchor her “joyful habit.” She noted that both children are now adults pursuing their own creative careers, a development she described as “the most rewarding sequel to our own story.”

## Mindset in the Age of Mental‑Health Awareness  
The interview arrived amid a surge in public discourse on wellbeing; a 2024 YouGov poll showed 68 % of Britons consider mental health a top personal priority. Curtis, who has spoken openly about her own battles with anxiety after the 1990s, argued that “recognising the small pleasures— a good cup of tea, a sunrise—creates a buffer against the noise.” She referenced a personal practice of writing three gratitude points each night, a habit she adopted in 2019 and which, according to a 2023 Harvard study, can improve sleep quality by up to 15 %.

## Legacy and Future Projects  
Beyond acting, Curtis is slated to executive‑produce a documentary series on women in horror, slated for release in early 2025. She also confirmed a forthcoming memoir, *Joyful: My Life in Film and Family*, due in spring 2025, which will expand on the themes discussed in the interview. As she looks ahead, Curtis maintains that the “joy of life” is not a static trait but a daily decision, one she hopes to model for both industry peers and the next generation of storytellers.
