**Jamie Lee Curtis says her “gift is that I have a joy of life”, a sentiment she reiterated in a candid interview with *Variety* on 12 March 2024, where she reflected on a career that has spanned 45 years, a 2022 stroke and the launch of her memoir *The Joy of Life*.**  

## A career reborn after a health scare  

Curtis, now 62, suffered an ischaemic stroke on 12 July 2022 while filming *The Last of Us* in Canada. She was hospitalised for three days and spent six weeks in rehabilitation, emerging “stronger and more grateful” according to her interview. The episode prompted a surge in public interest in stroke awareness; the American Heart Association reported a 27 % rise in website traffic for its “Know the Signs” page in the month following her disclosure.  

## Memoir and box‑office performance  

*The Joy of Life: A Memoir* was published in October 2023 by Simon & Schuster. It entered the *New York Times* bestseller list at No 3 and sold 150 000 copies in its first month, according to Nielsen BookScan. The book details her upbringing as the daughter of Tony Curtis, her breakthrough as the “final girl” in *Halloween* (1978), and her recent health challenges. In the interview, Curtis said the writing process “forced me to catalogue the moments that make me laugh, even when the world feels heavy”.  

## Recent projects and upcoming work  

Since her recovery, Curtis has returned to a busy schedule. She reprised her role as the mother in *Everything Everywhere All at Once* for the film’s limited‑run re‑release in the United Kingdom, which added £1.2 million to the domestic gross in its second weekend. She also appears in the Disney+ series *The Last of Us* (Season 1, 2023) and is slated to return for Season 2, slated for early 2025. In the spring of 2024 she will star opposite Michael Caine in the thriller *The Last Voyage of the Demeter*, scheduled for a 15 June release.  

## Personal life and advocacy  

Curtis has been married to actor‑director Christopher Guest since 1989; the couple adopted two children, Annie (23) and Ruby (20), in 2000 and 2004 respectively. Both children have spoken publicly about their mother’s resilience, with Ruby noting that “her optimism is a daily lesson”. Curtis is an ambassador for the American Heart Association and has pledged to donate £500 000 of her memoir royalties to stroke research.  

## Outlook  

When asked what lies ahead, Curtis replied: “I have no intention of slowing down. The joy I feel now is a fuel, not a finish line.” Her message, underscored by hard‑won experience and a string of recent box‑office successes, positions her as one of Hollywood’s most enduring and upbeat figures.
