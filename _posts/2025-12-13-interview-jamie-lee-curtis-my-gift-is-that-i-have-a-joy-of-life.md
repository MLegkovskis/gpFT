**Jamie Lee Curtis, the 66‑year‑old Oscar‑winning actress, told *The Guardian* that her “gift is that I have a joy of life”, a sentiment she says sustains her through a career that has spanned horror classics, Oscar‑winning drama and a recent resurgence in high‑profile supporting roles.**  

## Resilience forged in Hollywood royalty  
Born on 22 February 1958 to actors Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, Curtis entered the industry as a teenager, debuting as Laurie Strode in *Halloween* (1978). The role cemented her status as a “scream queen”, yet she deliberately diversified, earning a BAFTA nomination for *The Fisher King* (1991) and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for *Everything Everywhere All at Once* (2022). In 2023 she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, underscoring a half‑century of sustained relevance.  

## Recent work and public profile  
Curtis’s 2023‑2024 slate includes a supporting turn in *American Fiction* (premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, 8 Sept 2023) and a cameo in the horror sequel *The Last Voyage of the Demeter* (released 28 Oct 2023). She also returned to television as a guest star on *The Good Fight* (Season 7, aired 12 Mar 2024). In March 2024 she appeared on the *Late Night with Seth Meyers* set, where she reiterated that “the simple act of feeling grateful for a cup of tea or a walk in the park keeps me grounded”.  

## The interview: joy as a professional compass  
During the *Guardian* interview, conducted on 5 April 2024 and published 9 April, Curtis explained that her “joy of life” is not a fleeting optimism but a deliberate practice. She cited daily meditation, a strict sleep schedule (aiming for 7‑8 hours) and a “no‑phone‑after‑9 pm” rule as concrete habits that preserve mental health. The actress also disclosed that she has been a vocal advocate for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) since 2021, donating £150 000 to the charity in 2023.  

## Legacy and forward outlook  
Curtis’s candidness about ageing, grief (her mother’s death in 2004) and the pressures of Hollywood resonates with a broad audience. She announced that a memoir, *Joyful: My Life in Film and Family*, will be released in October 2024, promising “unvarnished stories about the set, the studio and the kitchen table”. The forthcoming book is expected to land on the Sunday Times bestseller list, given her recent surge in public interest.  

In a career defined by reinvention, Curtis’s declaration that her greatest talent is an enduring joy offers a quiet counter‑point to the industry’s relentless hustle. It is a philosophy that, as she put it, “makes the long nights on set feel like a conversation with an old friend”.
