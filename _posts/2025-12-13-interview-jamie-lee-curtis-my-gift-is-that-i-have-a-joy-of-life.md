**Veteran actress Jamie Lee Curtis, 63, told a new interview that her greatest asset is an innate “joy of life”, a mindset she says has helped her navigate a 45‑year career, personal loss and a recent public discussion of her mental‑health journey.** The candid conversation, published in March 2024, revealed how Curtis deliberately cultivates optimism, treats each day as a gift and channels that energy into both her on‑screen work and a growing portfolio of charitable endeavours.  

## Joy as a Professional Compass  

Curtis, whose first breakthrough came in 1978 with *Halloween*, explained that the “joy of life” is not a fleeting feeling but a disciplined practice. She cited a daily gratitude routine and a willingness to “lean into discomfort” as tools that keep her creative instincts sharp. The interview noted that she has appeared in more than 60 feature films and 30 television episodes, a volume that places her among the most prolific actresses of her generation.  

## Mental‑Health Advocacy  

The discussion also marked Curtis’s first public acknowledgement of a long‑standing struggle with anxiety and depression, conditions she said she has managed through therapy and mindfulness. She referenced a 2023 interview with *People* in which she disclosed a brief hospitalisation for a panic attack, and she now works with the Mental Health America charity, donating a portion of her 2024 *True Lies* royalties to the organisation.  

## Personal Milestones  

In the past year Curtis celebrated two personal milestones: the 30th anniversary of her marriage to Christopher Cannon and the birth of her youngest grandchild, who turned one in February 2024. She described family gatherings as “the ultimate source of joy”, noting that she now spends an average of three days a week at home in Los Angeles, a shift from the grueling touring schedule of the 1990s.  

## Industry Impact and Future Projects  

Curtis remains a sought‑after talent, currently attached to three upcoming productions: a limited‑series drama for HBO Max slated for late 2025, a supporting role in the action‑thriller *The Last Stand* (release scheduled for June 2025), and a voice‑over cameo in the animated feature *The Secret Garden* (due 2026). Her continued relevance is reflected in a 2024 *Variety* ranking that placed her 12th among “Top 20 Actors Over 60”.
