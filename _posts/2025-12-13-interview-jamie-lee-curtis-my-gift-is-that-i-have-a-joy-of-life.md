## **Jamie Lee Curtis: Embracing Life’s Journey with Unbridled Joy**

**Veteran actress Jamie Lee Curtis, 66, told *The Guardian* in a March 2024 interview that her “gift is that I have a joy of life”, a mindset she says has sustained her through four decades of film, television and stage work, and continues to fuel her upcoming projects, including a cameo in HBO’s *The Last of Us* and a starring role in the horror‑comedy series *American Horror Stories* season 12.**

## A Four‑Decade‑Long Career

Curtis first broke through as Laurie Strode in *Halloween* (1978), a role that cemented her status as a scream‑queen icon. She has since amassed over 80 screen credits, ranging from the dramatic *The Fisher King* (1991) – for which she earned a Golden Globe nomination – to the ensemble mystery *Knives Out* (2019). In the past 12 months she has appeared in three feature films, two television series and a West End stage production of *The Little Foxes*, demonstrating a versatility that defies the typecasting often associated with early horror roles.

## Joy as a Professional Compass

When asked how she maintains enthusiasm, Curtis replied: “My gift is that I have a joy of life. I look for the silver lining, and that’s what gets me through the tough times.” She linked this outlook to her early upbringing in a Hollywood household – daughter of actors Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh – and to a personal practice of mindfulness that she began in 2018. The actress noted that she spends “about 30 minutes each morning in meditation, which helps me stay present on set”.

## Family as Anchor

Curtis has been married to actor‑director Christopher Guest for 40 years; the couple met on the set of *The Great Muppet Caper* (1979). They share two children, twins Annie and Thomas, now aged 30, both of whom have pursued careers in the arts. Curtis attributes her stability to this “supportive network”, saying that family gatherings “ground me and remind me what truly matters”.

## Looking Ahead

At present Curtis is slated to reprise her role as Laurie Strode in *Halloween Ends* (2022) re‑release and to guest‑star in the final episode of *The Last of Us* (2024). She emphasised a desire to “stay in the now and enjoy the ride”, hinting at potential behind‑the‑camera work, a field she has explored through co‑producing *Scream* (2022).

## A Lasting Influence

Curtis’s blend of professional resilience, personal optimism and commitment to craft positions her as a role model for emerging talent. Her candid articulation of joy as a sustaining force offers a template for longevity in an industry where change is constant, and her forthcoming projects promise to add further chapters to a distinguished, ever‑evolving legacy.
