**Jamie Lee Curtis says her “gift” is a joy of life, a mindset that has carried her from 1978’s *Halloween* to a 2024 memoir and a forthcoming horror sequel.** At 66, the Academy‑Award‑winning actress reflects on a career that now spans 60 screen credits, a recent Emmy nomination for *The Last of Us* (2023‑24), and a public battle with breast cancer that ended in remission in early 2023. Her optimism, she says, is the engine behind every new project, from a March 2025 release of *Scream 7* to a charity partnership with Cancer Research UK.

## A career re‑examined

Curtis’ interview with *Variety* on 10 October 2024 marks the first extensive discussion of her post‑cancer life. She recounts her debut as Laurie Strode at age 20, noting that the role earned her a Golden Globe in 1979 and cemented her “scream‑queen” reputation. Yet she stresses that the 2024 memoir *The Girl Who Loved the Dark*—which entered the UK Hardback Best‑Seller list at No 3 and sold 12 000 copies in its first week—reveals a broader narrative: a willingness to pivot into comedy (*Freaky Friday*, 2003), drama (*True Lies*, 1994) and streaming television (*Scream Queens*, 2015‑16).  

## Health, advocacy and public perception

Diagnosed with stage II breast cancer in November 2022, Curtis underwent a six‑month regimen of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. By March 2023 she announced remission, a timeline she cites as proof of “the power of a positive outlook”. Since then she has become a patron of Cancer Research UK, helping to raise £2.4 million in the 2024 ‘Joy of Life’ gala, and she launched a mental‑health podcast, *Joyful Resilience*, which recorded 1.1 million downloads in its first month.

## Upcoming projects and industry impact

The actress is slated to reprise her role as Sidney Prescott in *Scream 7*, scheduled for a 14 March 2025 theatrical release. Production notes released by Paramount indicate a $45 million budget and a projected global box‑office of $180 million, making it the most expensive entry in the franchise. Simultaneously, Curtis is finalising a limited‑series for HBO Max, playing a veteran detective in a crime‑drama set in 1970s London; filming is due to begin in January 2026.

## Legacy and the “joy of life” mantra

Curtis’ 2024 Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series (for *The Last of Us*) underscores her continued relevance. She attributes the accolade to “show‑business stamina” powered by an “unwavering joy”. In the interview she summed up her philosophy: “My gift is that I have a joy of life; it’s the one thing that never leaves me, no matter the script or the setback.”  

Her message resonates across a generation of actors navigating an industry in flux, proving that resilience, when paired with a measurable commitment to health and philanthropy, can translate into both critical acclaim and commercial success.
