**Investors are scrambling for protection as the rapid build‑up of AI‑linked debt threatens to become the next major market shock.** Global bond markets now hold roughly **$1.2 trillion** of AI‑related bonds – a figure that dwarfs the $400 billion raised by internet firms during the dot‑com boom and represents about **2 % of U.S. GDP**. High‑yield issuers are already feeling the strain, with spreads widening and flagship bonds such as Oracle’s 30‑year issue trading at a steep discount. The scale of borrowing, the concentration in a handful of hyperscalers and the debt‑driven nature of the boom have prompted leading economists and regulators to warn of a potential “AI‑debt bust” that could spill over into broader credit markets.

The exposure is not limited to a niche of tech‑savvy investors. A Wharton School analysis estimates that **≈ 40 % of current labour income** could be affected by generative‑AI automation, underscoring the macro‑economic relevance of the sector’s financing needs. Morgan Stanley projects **≈ $3 trillion** of additional AI‑linked capital expenditure over the next three years, while the “Magnificent 7” tech giants are slated to spend **$344 billion** on AI‑related capex in 2025 – roughly **1.1 % of U.S. GDP**. This spending has already become a material driver of growth: Bank of America attributes **up to 1.3 percentage points** of U.S. Q2 2025 GDP growth to AI‑related investment, and Harvard research claims **92 %** of the first‑half‑2025 growth stemmed from AI data‑centre and supporting technology spending.

Yet the upside is fragile. Barclays warns that a **20‑30 % decline in AI‑related equity valuations** could shave **one to 1.5 percentage points** off GDP growth over a year. In the high‑yield segment, credit‑risk indicators are already flashing red – five‑year CDS spreads on Oracle have widened to **80 basis points**, the widest in two years, while other AI issuers face similar pressure. Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi has cautioned that AI‑sector debt “eclipses the borrowing by tech companies in the years before the dot‑com bubble popped” and could “be felt across markets more broadly”.

Comparisons with past market excesses sharpen the picture. The dot‑com bubble saw **≈ $400 billion** of new tech bond issuance, a figure roughly one‑third of today’s AI debt surge. Moreover, the dot‑com era was largely equity‑driven; the current AI wave is **debt‑heavy**, with long‑dated bonds financing data‑centre construction and GPU farms, thereby extending duration risk for investors. By contrast, the 2008 financial crisis involved a **$10.5 trillion** rise in total U.S. corporate debt, but that shock was rooted in mortgage‑backed securities and a system‑wide credit crunch. AI‑related debt, while still a fraction of total corporate leverage, is **highly concentrated** in a few large firms and in the high‑yield space, creating a distinct contagion channel that could transmit stress to pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and private‑credit vehicles.

Regulators are beginning to take notice. The Federal Reserve’s latest statement flags AI‑sector leverage as a monitoring priority, though no major policy shift has yet been announced. Meanwhile, market participants are seeking hedges: investors are buying credit‑default swaps on flagship AI issuers and demanding higher yields on new issues. Oversubscription remains strong – Meta’s recent AI‑focused bond was **four‑times oversubscribed** – but the appetite is tempered by growing scepticism about the sector’s revenue outlook.

The emerging picture is one of a **rapidly expanding, debt‑laden AI ecosystem** that has become a pivotal engine of short‑term growth but also a potential source of systemic risk. As the market digests the latest data‑centre spend and the bond market adjusts to widening spreads, investors are likely to tighten credit standards and diversify away from AI‑heavy exposure. The coming months will test whether the sector can sustain its growth narrative or whether a correction will echo the lessons of the dot‑com bust and, on a smaller scale, the 2008 crisis.
