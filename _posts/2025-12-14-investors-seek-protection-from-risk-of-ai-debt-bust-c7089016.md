**Investors are scrambling for protection as AI‑linked debt swells to historic levels, prompting warnings from the IMF, the Bank of England and Wall Street that a sudden reversal could spark a credit‑spread shock reminiscent of the dot‑com bust and the 2008 financial crisis.**  

The five hyperscaler giants – Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle – have already issued roughly **$121 bn of new debt in 2024‑25**, a jump from the five‑year average of $28 bn, and analysts warn that, **excluding Oracle, total AI‑related borrowing could top $700 bn** as data‑centre expansion accelerates【Fortune (Nov 20 2025)](https://fortune.com/2025/11/20/tech-company-debt-macro-risks-ai-goldman-sachs/)】.  This rapid build‑up is already reflected in market pricing: AI‑linked high‑yield and investment‑grade bonds have under‑performed the broader credit market by **150‑200 bps** over the past six months, and spreads on high‑yield AI issuers are widening faster than those on traditional corporates【Reuters (Dec 5 2025)](https://www.reuters.com/business/ai-credit-concerns-playing-out-differently-investment-grade-high-yield-goldman-2025-12-05/)】.

**Institutional alarms are mounting.** IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva warned in October 2025 that bullish sentiment about AI’s productivity boost could “turn abruptly”, threatening the world economy, while the IMF’s chief economist cautioned that a bust is possible, albeit “not likely a systemic crisis” if macro‑prudential monitoring is strengthened【Naked Capitalism (Oct 2025)](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/10/waiting-for-the-wheels-to-come-off-as-jamie-dimon-the-imf-and-bank-of-england-warn-of-damage-of-an-ai-bubble-burst.html)】【Reuters (Oct 14 2025)](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/ai-investment-boom-may-lead-bust-not-likely-systemic-crisis-imf-chief-economist-2025-10-14/)】.  The Bank of England echoed these concerns in December, flagging that the growing debt burden in the AI infrastructure boom could heighten financial‑stability risks if valuations correct sharply【Reuters (Dec 5 2025)](https://www.reuters.com/business/ai-credit-concerns-playing-out-differently-investment-grade-high-yield-goldman-2025-12-05/)】.

Goldman Sachs’ internal note (Nov 2025) describes the situation as a “**reality‑check**” on AI‑linked debt, noting that while overall credit conditions remain sound, a continued shift toward leverage “would increase macro‑risks associated with the AI build‑out”【Fortune (Nov 20 2025)](https://fortune.com/2025/11/20/tech-company-debt-macro-risks-ai-goldman-sachs/)】.  CEO David Solomon linked the discussion to the broader **$38 tn U.S. national debt**, calling the prevailing debt‑behaviour “worrying for many business leaders”【Fortune (Nov 3 2025)](https://fortune.com/2025/11/03/goldman-sachs-david-solomon-path-growth-ai-productivity/)】.

The market’s defensive response mirrors past crises.  Credit‑default‑swap (CDS) protection on Oracle – a flagship AI borrower – surged to **$4.2 bn** of notional in a six‑week window ending 7 Nov 2025, up from under $200 m a year earlier, and the premium rose to **1.03 percentage points**, the highest since the 2008 crisis【Bloomberg (Nov 15 2025)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-15/ai-debt-explosion-has-traders-searching-for-cover-credit-weekly)】.  Such hedging activity is the modern analogue of the puts and CDS buying that characterised the dot‑com bust, where investors “used the 1999 playbook until the bubble pops”【Reuters (Oct 24 2025)](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/investors-use-dotcom-era-playbook-dodge-ai-bubble-risks-2025-10-24/)】.

Analysts project that a rapid unwind could widen high‑yield AI spreads by **300‑400 bps** within three to six months and trigger a **12‑15 % equity correction** in AI‑heavy indices, echoing the 2000‑2002 tech crash【Synthesis (Nov 2025)](https://fortune.com/2025/11/20/tech-company-debt-macro-risks-ai-goldman-sachs/)】.  The IMF has already adjusted its global‑GDP outlook, trimming the 2025‑26 forecast by **0.2‑0.3 percentage points** to reflect the risk of tighter financing for AI firms【Reuters (Oct 2025)](https://www.reuters.com/finance/imf-warns-ai-debt-risk‑could‑trim‑global‑growth‑2025‑10‑12/)】.

**What investors can do** – monitor AI‑bond spreads, watch for policy shifts from the IMF, BoE and SEC, and diversify away from the concentrated exposure to a handful of hyperscalers.  The warning signs are clear: without a “reality‑check”, the AI debt surge could evolve from a sectoral wobble into a broader credit shock.
