**Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, has been named the Financial Times Person of the Year, a recognition that underscores his central role in steering the global surge in artificial‑intelligence computing and in reshaping the semiconductor industry.**  

## The award and its timing  

The Financial Times announced the honour on 12 December 2025, citing Huang’s “decisive leadership in turning a graphics‑card maker into the world’s pre‑eminent AI‑hardware supplier”. The accolade arrives just weeks after Nvidia reported its strongest quarterly performance on record, reinforcing the view that Huang’s strategic bets have paid off in real‑time.

## Nvidia’s financial trajectory under Huang  

Since Huang took the reins in 1993, Nvidia’s market capitalisation has risen from roughly US$1 billion in 2000 to about US$1.2 trillion at the close of the 2024 fiscal year – a 1,200 per cent increase. Revenue for the second quarter of FY 2025 (ended 30 June 2025) hit US$13.5 billion, up 23 per cent year‑on‑year, while AI‑related sales accounted for 71 per cent of total revenue, up from 58 per cent a year earlier. Gross margins widened to 68 per cent, reflecting the premium pricing of the new H100 and GH200 GPUs that dominate data‑centre deployments.

## The AI boom and Nvidia’s ecosystem  

Nvidia’s GPUs now power an estimated 80 per cent of the world’s AI training workloads, according to a joint report by the International Data Corporation and the Semiconductor Industry Association (June 2025). The company’s CUDA software platform, launched in 2006, has become the de‑facto standard for developers, with more than 30 million active users worldwide. Huang’s 2023 “AI‑first” strategy, which pledged to allocate US$10 billion to AI research and ecosystem development, has been credited with accelerating the adoption of generative‑AI models in sectors ranging from finance to pharmaceuticals.

## Industry impact and broader influence  

Beyond Nvidia, Huang has been a vocal advocate for responsible AI governance, testifying before the US Senate Commerce Committee in March 2025 on the need for standards on model transparency and data provenance. His public statements on AI safety have shaped policy discussions in the EU and China, prompting coordinated efforts on AI risk assessment. Analysts at Morgan Stanley now assign a “high‑conviction” rating to Nvidia, citing Huang’s ability to translate technological leadership into sustained commercial advantage.

## Looking ahead  

The AI market is projected to exceed US$1 trillion by 2030, with data‑centre spend expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 27 per cent (Gartner, 2025). Huang has signalled that Nvidia will expand beyond hardware, targeting software‑as‑a‑service offerings and edge‑computing solutions. The company’s roadmap includes the forthcoming “Blackwell” architecture, slated for early 2026, which promises a further 2‑fold increase in tensor‑core performance.

## Conclusion  

Jensen Huang’s designation as FT Person of the Year encapsulates a decade‑long transformation of Nvidia from a niche graphics chipmaker into the linchpin of the AI revolution. His blend of technical vision, disciplined capital allocation and public‑policy engagement has not only delivered shareholder value but also set the agenda for the next wave of intelligent technologies.
