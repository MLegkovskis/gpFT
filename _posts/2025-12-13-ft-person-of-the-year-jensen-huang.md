**Jensen Huang, founder and chief executive of Nvidia, has been named the Financial Times Person of the Year, a recognition that underscores his pivotal role in turning the company into the world’s most valuable AI‑chipmaker and propelling the broader artificial‑intelligence boom.**  Huang’s stewardship has seen Nvidia’s market capitalisation climb to roughly **$1.2 trillion** in October 2024, a rise of more than **600 %** since the start of 2019, while its data‑centre revenue surged **61 %** to **$14.5 billion** in FY 2022 and reached **$16.3 billion** in FY 2024, accounting for over half of total sales.

## The AI Engine Behind the Surge  

Since launching the CUDA parallel‑computing platform in 2006, Nvidia has repositioned its graphics‑processing units (GPUs) as the de‑facto hardware for training large‑scale machine‑learning models. By 2018 Huang announced a strategic shift towards AI, allocating **$5 billion** to research and development that year – a figure that grew to **$7.5 billion** in FY 2024, representing **23 %** of total revenue. Nvidia’s A100 and H100 GPUs now power more than **80 %** of the top‑500 supercomputers and are embedded in the majority of cloud‑provider AI services.

## Market Impact and Shareholder Returns  

Nvidia’s share price, listed at **$115** on 1 January 2019, closed at **$820** on 12 October 2024, delivering a compound annual growth rate of **38 %**. The company’s earnings per share rose from **$0.45** in FY 2019 to **$3.12** in FY 2024, while free‑cash flow expanded from **$1.2 billion** to **$5.4 billion** over the same period. Institutional investors now hold **68 %** of Nvidia’s outstanding shares, up from **52 %** in 2019.

## Competitive Landscape and Regulatory Headwinds  

Despite its dominance, Nvidia confronts mounting competition from AMD’s Instinct line and Intel’s Xe‑HPC architecture, both targeting the same data‑centre market. Supply‑chain constraints in advanced‑node silicon have also prompted the firm to diversify its fab partners beyond TSMC. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has opened a preliminary review of Nvidia’s proposed acquisition of Arm Ltd., raising the prospect of antitrust scrutiny that could affect future growth trajectories.

## Outlook  

Looking ahead, Huang has outlined a three‑year roadmap centred on “AI‑first” products, including the upcoming GH200 Grace‑Hopper superchip, slated for release in early 2025. If demand for generative‑AI services continues its current trajectory – projected to grow at **45 %** annually through 2027 – Nvidia is positioned to retain its premium pricing power and further embed its technology across sectors ranging from autonomous transport to drug discovery.
