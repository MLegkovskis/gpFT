## **Jensen Huang Named Financial Times Person of the Year**

**Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang has been crowned the Financial Times Person of the Year, a recognition that reflects his decisive role in turning a niche graphics‑chip maker into a trillion‑dollar AI powerhouse and reshaping the global technology landscape within a single decade.**  

## The meteoric ascent of Nvidia under Huang  

Since taking charge of Nvidia in 1993, Huang has overseen a market‑capitalisation rise from roughly US$5 billion in 2015 to **US$1.23 trillion on 10 December 2024**, placing the firm among the world’s most valuable public companies. Revenue for the fiscal year ended 30 January 2024 hit **US$33.0 billion**, a 73 % increase year‑on‑year, driven largely by the AI‑focused data‑centre segment, which posted **US$22.9 billion** – a 150 % jump from the previous year.  

## AI as the engine of growth  

Huang’s strategic bet on artificial intelligence has paid off. Nvidia’s **H100 Tensor Core GPU**, launched in March 2023, now powers the majority of large‑language‑model training runs, including OpenAI’s GPT‑4 and Microsoft’s Azure AI services. In the most recent quarter, AI‑related sales accounted for **71 % of total revenue**, up from 45 % a year earlier. The company’s **CUDA software ecosystem**, now used by over 30 million developers, has cemented its lock‑in effect across research labs, cloud providers and autonomous‑vehicle firms.  

## Competitive pressures and sustainability concerns  

The triumph has not been unchallenged. AMD’s MI300 series and Intel’s Xe‑HPC line have begun eroding Nvidia’s dominance in high‑performance computing, prompting Huang to announce a **$2 billion investment in next‑generation chip architecture** at the 2024 GPU Technology Conference. Environmental groups have also flagged the energy intensity of AI training; Nvidia disclosed that its data‑centre GPUs consume **approximately 1.2 gigawatt‑hours per year**, prompting a pledge to achieve **net‑zero emissions by 2030** through renewable‑energy contracts and more efficient silicon.  

## A visionary at the helm  

Beyond the balance sheet, Huang’s influence extends to policy. He testified before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee in September 2024, urging a coordinated approach to AI safety and supply‑chain resilience. His advocacy for open standards, exemplified by the recent **Nvidia‑IBM collaboration on the OpenAI‑compatible Triton compiler**, underscores a belief that industry‑wide interoperability will accelerate innovation.  

## Conclusion  

Jensen Huang’s selection as the Financial Times Person of the Year encapsulates a decade in which a single executive reshaped the economics of computing, propelled AI from research labs to mainstream enterprise, and positioned Nvidia as a linchpin of the digital economy. As AI models grow larger and regulatory scrutiny intensifies, Huang’s blend of technical foresight and strategic boldness will likely continue to steer the sector’s trajectory.
