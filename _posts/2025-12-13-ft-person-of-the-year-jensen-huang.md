**Nvidia's CEO has led the company to unprecedented heights, with its stock price and market capitalization soaring over the past year**
Jensen Huang, the visionary CEO of Nvidia, has been named the FT Person of the Year, in recognition of his instrumental role in shaping the future of artificial intelligence and the tech sector. Under his leadership, Nvidia's stock price has climbed approximately 46% over the past 12 months, from around $120 to $175, while its market capitalization has grown by approximately 37%, from around $3.29 trillion to $4.51 trillion, cementing its position as the world's most valuable chipmaker.

Huang's AI-centric vision, product launches, and high-profile cloud-AI partnerships have been the driving forces behind Nvidia's rapid expansion. The company's market capitalization has reached unprecedented heights, surpassing $1 trillion, $2 trillion, $3 trillion, and $5 trillion milestones in quick succession.

His technical pedigree, entrepreneurial spirit, and personal story of immigration and hard work have driven his mission to position Nvidia as the de-facto AI compute platform. As he stated, "Artificial intelligence is the technology industry's single greatest contribution to social elevation, to lift all of the people that have historically been left behind."
