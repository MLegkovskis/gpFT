## **Jensen Huang Named Financial Times Person of the Year**
**Nvidia’s chief executive has been honoured for steering the company through an unprecedented AI boom, expanding revenue more than six‑fold in four years and lifting the firm’s market capitalisation to roughly $1.3 trillion, making it one of the world’s most valuable technology groups.**

## The AI‑driven surge
Nvidia’s graphics‑processing units have become the de‑facto hardware for large‑scale machine‑learning models. In the most recent quarter (Q3 FY 2025, ended 30 September), the company posted revenue of **$24.0 billion**, a **212 %** increase on the same period a year earlier, and **data‑centre sales of $15.2 billion**, up **274 %** year‑on‑year. Gross margin rose to **68.5 %**, reflecting the premium pricing of its AI‑focused GPUs.

## Huang’s strategic bets
Since taking the helm in 1993, Huang has pursued a “compute‑first” strategy, channeling cash flow into AI research, software ecosystems and strategic partnerships. In 2022 he launched the **Nvidia AI Enterprise** suite, now deployed by more than **1,200** enterprise customers, and in 2023 announced a **$25 billion** share‑repurchase programme to stabilise the stock amid market volatility. His outreach has secured collaborations with Microsoft’s Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, each integrating Nvidia’s H100 and GH200 chips into their AI infrastructure.

## Market impact
Nvidia’s rally has reshaped the broader tech landscape. By the close of October 2025 its market capitalisation stood at **$1.32 trillion**, overtaking both Amazon and Alphabet and placing it ahead of the S&P 500’s top‑five constituents. The company’s share price has risen **≈ 1,800 %** since the start of 2021, outpacing the Nasdaq‑100’s **≈ 650 %** gain over the same period.

## The wider AI economy
Analysts at McKinsey now project the global AI market to reach **$1.4 trillion by 2025**, with data‑centre hardware accounting for roughly **30 %** of that spend. Nvidia’s dominance in GPU supply has made it a bellwether for the sector; its quarterly guidance is routinely cited as a proxy for overall AI‑related capital expenditure.

## Headwinds and competition
Despite the meteoric rise, challenges loom. The semiconductor industry faces a **global supply‑chain tightening** that has pushed lead times for high‑end chips to **12‑14 weeks**. Rivals such as AMD and Intel are accelerating their own AI‑accelerator roadmaps, while Chinese firms receive state backing for domestic alternatives. Moreover, regulatory scrutiny over AI ethics and data privacy could introduce compliance costs that erode margins.

## A defining figure for the digital age
Huang’s selection as FT Person of the Year underscores the centrality of AI to the modern economy and recognises a leader who has turned a niche graphics chipmaker into a cornerstone of the global compute stack. As investors, policymakers and technologists watch the next phase of AI development, Huang’s vision and execution will remain a benchmark for corporate leadership in the era of artificial intelligence.
