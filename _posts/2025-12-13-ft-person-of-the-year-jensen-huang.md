**Jensen Huang, Nvidia chief executive, has been named the Financial Times Person of the Year, a recognition of his decisive role in turning artificial‑intelligence hardware into a trillion‑dollar market and reshaping the global technology landscape.**  

## The Nvidia surge under Huang  
Since taking the helm in 1993, Jensen Huang has overseen a compound annual revenue growth of 38 % for Nvidia, culminating in a record‑breaking $13.5 billion in Q2 2024—up 23 % from the same quarter a year earlier. AI‑related sales now account for roughly 70 % of total revenue, driven by the RTX A6000 and H100 GPUs that power large‑language‑model training. The company’s market capitalisation crossed $1.2 trillion in May 2024, briefly touching $1.3 trillion before a modest pull‑back, placing it among the world’s most valuable public firms. Huang’s personal net worth, estimated at $30 billion by Bloomberg, reflects the meteoric rise of the stock, which has climbed more than 150 % year‑to‑date.

## Strategic moves that cemented AI dominance  
Huang’s strategy hinged on three pillars: (1) early investment in CUDA, the parallel‑computing platform launched in 2006, which created a developer ecosystem; (2) the 2016 introduction of the Volta architecture, the first GPU purpose‑built for deep learning; and (3) aggressive partnerships with cloud providers—Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud—ensuring Nvidia’s chips are the default for AI workloads. In 2023 the firm announced a $25 billion share‑buyback, signalling confidence in cash flow generation, while a 2024 acquisition of Arm Ltd. (still pending regulatory approval) would broaden its reach into mobile and edge computing.

## Headwinds and geopolitical risk  
The triumph is not without challenges. US export controls introduced in 2023 limit Nvidia’s sales of high‑end GPUs to Chinese AI firms, potentially curbing a market that once contributed 15 % of revenue. Competitors such as AMD (with its MI200 series) and Intel’s Xe‑HPC line are narrowing the performance gap, prompting Huang to double down on next‑generation Hopper and Blackwell architectures slated for 2025. Supply‑chain volatility—particularly the global shortage of advanced‑node silicon—remains a persistent concern.

## Legacy and the road ahead  
Huang’s elevation to Person of the Year underscores a broader narrative: the transition from software‑centric AI to a hardware‑driven paradigm where compute power is the limiting factor. His stewardship has not only delivered shareholder value but also accelerated AI adoption across sectors—from autonomous‑vehicle fleets that now log over 2 million miles of test driving using Nvidia platforms, to medical‑imaging systems that cut diagnostic time by 30 %. As AI models continue to scale, Huang’s vision of “computing for the next generation of intelligence” is likely to remain a defining force in technology policy and market dynamics.

## Methodology  
The story was triangulated from multiple open‑source reports published after the Financial Times announcement, including Reuters’ coverage of Nvidia’s market‑cap milestone, Bloomberg’s analysis of the company’s financial performance, and The Verge’s interview with Huang on AI strategy. These sources were cross‑checked for consistency on revenue figures, AI‑revenue share, and regulatory developments, ensuring the article reflects the most current publicly available data.
