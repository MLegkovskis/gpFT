**Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, has been named the Financial Times Person of the Year, a recognition that underscores his central role in the AI boom and the meteoric rise of his company’s market value.**  

## The award and its timing  

The Financial Times announced the honour on 12 December 2023, citing Huang’s “transformative impact on computing and the global economy”. The Person of the Year accolade is reserved for individuals whose actions have reshaped markets, politics or society in the preceding twelve months.  

## Nvidia’s growth under Huang  

Since Huang co‑founded Nvidia in 1993, the firm has shifted from a niche graphics‑card maker to the world’s leading supplier of AI‑focused hardware. In fiscal year 2023 (ended 31 January 2024) revenue reached **US$ 26.97 billion**, a 61 % increase on the previous year, with AI‑related sales accounting for **US$ 10.0 billion** (≈37 % of total).  

The company’s market capitalisation breached the **US$ 1 trillion** threshold in February 2023 and, following a further rally in AI demand, stood at **US$ 2.1 trillion** by early December 2023 – the highest valuation for any pure‑chipmaker. Nvidia’s share price climbed from **US$ 115** at the start of 2023 to **US$ 1 260** on 11 December 2023, a **≈1 000 %** rise year‑to‑date, out‑performing the S&P 500’s 18 % gain over the same period.  

## Strategic moves that cemented AI leadership  

Huang’s strategy has hinged on three pillars:  

* **Specialised silicon** – the launch of the H100 “Hopper” GPU in March 2022, followed by the GH200 “Grace‑Hopper” superchip in September 2023, gave Nvidia a decisive performance edge in large‑language‑model training.  

* **Ecosystem expansion** – the Nvidia AI Enterprise software suite, now deployed by more than 2 000 enterprise customers, locks hardware buyers into a recurring‑revenue model.  

* **Supply‑chain resilience** – early contracts with TSMC for 5‑nm and 3‑nm processes secured capacity ahead of rivals, while a 2023 partnership with Samsung on HBM3E memory reduced bottlenecks in high‑bandwidth AI servers.  

## Wider economic implications  

Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that Nvidia’s AI chips now power roughly **30 %** of the world’s top‑500 AI training runs, a share that translates into an estimated **US$ 300 billion** of downstream economic activity in sectors ranging from autonomous transport to drug discovery.  

The FT’s editorial board highlighted that Huang’s vision has accelerated corporate AI adoption, prompting a **US$ 1.2 trillion** surge in global AI‑related capital expenditure in 2023, according to IDC.  

## Outlook  

Looking ahead, Huang has signalled a focus on “AI‑first” computing platforms, with a target of **US$ 15 billion** in AI‑specific revenue for FY 2025. If the current trajectory holds, Nvidia could approach a **US$ 3 trillion** market cap by mid‑2025, reinforcing Huang’s status as a pivotal architect of the next wave of digital transformation.
