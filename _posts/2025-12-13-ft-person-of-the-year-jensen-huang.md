**Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, has been named the Financial Times Person of the Year 2025 in recognition of his decisive role in turning artificial‑intelligence chips into the world’s most valuable commodity, propelling Nvidia to a market capitalisation that briefly topped $1.2 trillion and making the firm the first semiconductor company to breach the $4 trillion‑valuation threshold in market‑cap terms.**  

## The AI‑driven surge

Since Huang took the reins in 1993, Nvidia has shifted from a niche graphics‑processor maker to the de‑facto supplier of AI compute. In 2024 AI‑related revenue reached $26.0 billion, a 45 % year‑on‑year increase, and analysts project $30 billion for 2025. The company’s A100 and H100 GPUs now power more than 90 % of the training workloads for the leading large‑language models, according to independent market surveys. This dominance has underpinned Nvidia’s share price, which climbed from $150 in early 2023 to $285 by November 2025, lifting the firm’s market value to a historic high.

## Huang’s personal narrative

Born in Taiwan and educated in electrical engineering at Oregon State and Stanford, Huang co‑founded Nvidia with two former colleagues in 1993. His tenure of 33 years makes him one of the longest‑serving CEOs in the sector. In a recent interview he said, “I work from the moment I wake up to sleep. I have no hobbies. Everything that matters to me is, first, taking care of my family, and then – working 100 %.” The FT highlighted this single‑minded focus as a key factor in the company’s relentless execution.

## Strategic moves and partnerships

Nvidia’s strategy has combined product innovation with high‑profile alliances. The 2023 acquisition of Arm Ltd., although still pending regulatory approval, is intended to extend Nvidia’s architecture into mobile and edge devices. Partnerships with Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud have embedded Nvidia’s GPUs in the leading public‑cloud AI stacks, securing multi‑year contracts worth an estimated $12 billion in total revenue.

## Headwinds and sustainability concerns

The AI boom has attracted rivals. Google’s Tensor‑Flow chips, Amazon’s Trainium and Microsoft’s custom silicon are eroding Nvidia’s monopoly on data‑centre GPUs. Moreover, the energy intensity of AI training—estimated at 200 megawatt‑hours per major model—has prompted scrutiny from regulators and environmental groups. Huang has pledged a “green‑by‑design” roadmap, targeting a 30 % reduction in the carbon intensity of Nvidia’s data‑centre products by 2030.

## Outlook

The FT’s Person of the Year accolade cements Huang’s status as the architect of the current AI wave. With AI projected to contribute $15 trillion to global GDP by 2030, Nvidia’s trajectory under Huang will likely remain a bellwether for the broader technology sector, even as competition intensifies and sustainability pressures mount.
