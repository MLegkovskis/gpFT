## **Jensen Huang Crowned FT Person of the Year for Steering Nvidia into the AI Age**  
**Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, has been named the Financial Times Person of the Year, a recognition that reflects his decisive role in turning the company from a graphics‑chip specialist into a $1.2 trillion AI powerhouse whose GPUs now underpin the majority of large‑scale machine‑learning workloads worldwide.**  

## The award and its timing  
The FT announced the honour on 2 December 2024, citing Huang’s “unparalleled ability to anticipate and shape the trajectory of artificial intelligence”. The accolade arrives as Nvidia’s share price has risen more than 300 % over the past twelve months, and its market capitalisation briefly breached the $1 trillion threshold in August 2024 before settling at roughly $1.2 trillion in early October 2024【1】.  

## Nvidia’s transformation under Huang  
When Huang co‑founded Nvidia in 1993 and took the helm as CEO in 2008, the firm was a niche supplier of graphics processing units for gaming. A strategic pivot announced in 2016 – the “GPU for AI” initiative – redirected R&D spend toward deep‑learning acceleration. By fiscal year 2024, AI‑related revenue accounted for 58 % of total sales, reaching $13.2 billion, up 210 % year‑on‑year【2】.  

## Market performance and financials  
* **Revenue:** $26.0 billion in FY 2024, a 115 % increase from FY 2023.  
* **Net profit:** $9.8 billion, up 140 % YoY.  
* **Stock performance:** From $120 in December 2023 to $470 in November 2024, a 292 % gain.  
* **AI data‑centre segment:** $15.0 billion in sales, representing 58 % of total revenue, with a gross margin of 71 %【3】.  

These figures have propelled Nvidia into the ranks of the world’s most valuable public companies, overtaking traditional semiconductor giants such as Intel in market value.  

## Leadership style and vision  
Huang is renowned for a hands‑on, engineering‑first approach. He allocates roughly 30 % of Nvidia’s $5 billion annual R&D budget to speculative projects, including the development of the next‑generation Hopper architecture and the Omniverse simulation platform. His public speeches consistently stress “democratise AI”, urging developers to access powerful tools via the company’s cloud‑based AI‑as‑a‑service offering, which grew 85 % in annual recurring revenue in 2024【4】.  

## Wider impact on the tech ecosystem  
Nvidia’s dominance has reshaped supply chains: major cloud providers – Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud – now source the bulk of their AI compute from Nvidia’s data‑centre GPUs. The company’s ecosystem has spawned a surge in AI start‑ups, with venture capital funding for AI‑focused firms reaching a record $150 billion in 2024, a trend analysts attribute partly to Nvidia’s “GPU‑first” paradigm【5】.  

## Outlook  
Looking ahead, Huang has signalled a focus on “AI‑centric computing”, targeting sectors such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare imaging and generative content creation. The forthcoming “Blackwell” GPU, slated for early 2025, is expected to double tensor‑core performance, potentially pushing Nvidia’s AI revenue past $20 billion by FY 2026.  

## Conclusion  
Jensen Huang’s elevation to FT Person of the Year encapsulates a decade‑long metamorphosis from a niche chipmaker to the linchpin of the global AI infrastructure. His blend of technical acumen, aggressive investment in emerging technologies and clear articulation of AI’s societal promise has not only reshaped Nvidia but also accelerated the broader digital transformation of the world economy.
