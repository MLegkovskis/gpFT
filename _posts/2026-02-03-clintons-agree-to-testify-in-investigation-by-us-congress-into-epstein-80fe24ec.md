# Clintons Agree to Testify in Epstein Investigation
The House Oversight Committee's investigation into Jeffrey Epstein has taken a significant step forward, with Bill and Hillary Clinton agreeing to testify. The testimony will be in the form of closed-door, transcribed depositions, focusing on the Clintons' connections with Epstein.

## Expected Scope of Testimony
The committee is expected to focus on the Clintons' personal and professional contacts with Epstein, including flights on his private jet and visits to his residences. The testimony may also cover any knowledge the Clintons had of Epstein's illegal activities.

## Potential Implications
The investigation may have implications for the ongoing discussions about sex trafficking and abuse of power. The testimony could provide new evidence and insights into Epstein's network, and may lead to new legislation and increased public awareness of these issues.
