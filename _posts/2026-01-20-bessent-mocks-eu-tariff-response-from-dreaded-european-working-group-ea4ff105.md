# U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Mocks EU Tariff Response
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has mocked the EU's coordinated tariff response to the U.S. threat of imposing a 10% tariff on EU goods unless Denmark cedes Greenland to the United States. Bessent's comments reflect the U.S. Treasury's hard-line stance on EU trade policies, warning that retaliatory tariffs would lead to escalation.
## Background
The dispute began when President Donald Trump announced on August 26, 2025, that the United States would impose a 10% tariff on all goods imported from eight EU members unless Denmark agreed to cede Greenland to the United States. The EU has been preparing a coordinated response, with a working group drafting a potential 10% retaliatory tariff on $12 billion of U.S. exports.
## Bessent's Comments
At the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 19, 2026, Bessent said Europe's response would be 'very unwise' and warned that retaliatory tariffs would only lead to escalation. He also mocked the EU's 'dreaded European working group' that was drafting a coordinated tariff response, calling it a 'laughable, over-hyped exercise that will achieve nothing.'
## EU Reaction
The EU has reacted strongly to Bessent's comments, with EU leaders stating that Europe would defend its sovereignty and was preparing counter-measures. The EU has also accelerated non-U.S. trade agreements worth €45 billion, including a Mercosur deal worth €30 billion in annual trade.
## Diplomatic Implications
The diplomatic implications of Bessent's comments are significant, with the potential to erode trust in the trans-Atlantic alliance and escalate the trade dispute. The EU is expected to file a formal protest at the WTO within 30 days of any U.S. tariff implementation, citing 'unfair trade practices' and 'politically motivated coercion.'
