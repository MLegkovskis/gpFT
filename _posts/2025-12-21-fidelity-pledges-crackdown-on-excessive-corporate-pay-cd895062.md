**Fidelity has announced a renewed focus on curbing excessive executive remuneration, but the firm has not disclosed how many of its portfolio companies breach the widely‑cited 100‑to‑1 CEO‑to‑median‑employee pay ratio.** While the asset manager’s stewardship materials outline a systematic approach to assessing pay alignment, they stop short of publishing an aggregate figure that would allow investors to gauge the scale of the issue across its holdings.

The firm’s latest proxy‑voting and stewardship guide explains that Fidelity evaluates executive compensation against company performance and peer benchmarks, flagging any firm that appears to have “poor alignment” for deeper review. This methodology is detailed in a 2024 PDF that covers data up to December 2023, describing metrics such as pay‑to‑fundamentals ratios and industry‑deviation analysis. However, the document does not contain a summary statistic on the proportion of portfolio firms whose CEO‑to‑median‑employee compensation ratios exceed 100 : 1.

External research underscores the relevance of such a metric. The Institute for Policy Studies’ *Executive Excess Report 2025* highlights that many public companies exhibit pay gaps far beyond the 100‑to‑1 threshold, with the Low‑Wage 100 average reaching 632 : 1 in 2024. Similarly, Madison Trust’s 2024 visualisation of S&P 500 firms shows a wide distribution of CEO‑to‑worker ratios, confirming that extreme disparities are commonplace in the broader market. Yet, neither source disaggregates the data to isolate Fidelity’s specific holdings, leaving a gap in public knowledge about the asset manager’s exposure to the most egregious cases.

The absence of a disclosed percentage is notable given the heightened scrutiny of pay equity among institutional investors. Fidelity’s pledge to intensify oversight aligns with a broader industry trend where asset managers are increasingly using voting power to influence remuneration policies. Nonetheless, without a clear baseline, it is difficult for shareholders and analysts to assess the effectiveness of Fidelity’s new stance or to compare it with similar initiatives launched by peers over the past decade.

Critics may argue that the lack of transparency hampers accountability, especially as activist shareholders continue to press for tighter caps on executive pay. Proponents, however, point to Fidelity’s detailed analytical framework as evidence of a rigorous, data‑driven process that can identify and address misaligned compensation before it escalates. The firm’s willingness to publicly articulate its evaluation criteria could be seen as a step toward greater openness, even if the ultimate outcomes remain undisclosed.

In the meantime, investors seeking insight into pay disparities within Fidelity’s portfolio must rely on broader market indicators rather than firm‑specific metrics. The gap highlights a persistent challenge for the asset management industry: balancing the need for granular, portfolio‑level data with the confidentiality constraints that often surround proprietary stewardship analyses. As the debate over executive pay intensifies, the demand for clearer reporting is likely to grow, putting pressure on Fidelity and its peers to provide more concrete evidence of the impact of their governance interventions.
