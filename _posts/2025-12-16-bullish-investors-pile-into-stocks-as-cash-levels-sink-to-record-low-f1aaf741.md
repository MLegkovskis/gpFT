**Bullish investors pile into stocks as cash levels sink to a record‑low 3.3 % of assets under management, signalling unprecedented confidence in equity markets.** The Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey conducted between 5 and 11 December 2025 revealed that fund managers now keep just 3.3 % of their portfolios in cash – the lowest proportion recorded in the past fifteen years and well below the long‑term average of roughly 6 %. The plunge follows a steady decline from the 5‑6 % cash buffers typical of 2021‑22, underscoring a decisive shift from caution to aggressive asset allocation.

The December figure eclipses the 3.5 % level reported in February 2025, itself described at the time as the lowest since 2010 when cash holdings dipped to 2.9 %. By early March, Yahoo Finance noted a marginal rise to 3.9 %, but the overarching trend remains unmistakably downward. In absolute terms, cash has fallen by about 2.7 percentage points – a reduction of roughly 45 % relative to the historical norm. Such a contraction suggests that professional investors have deployed the bulk of their liquid resources into equities, commodities and other risk‑on instruments, leaving a thin safety cushion for sudden market dislocations.

The drivers behind this aggressive posture are multifaceted. Strong corporate earnings, resilient consumer demand and accommodative monetary policy have combined to create a favourable risk‑on environment. Moreover, the perception that equity valuations remain attractive relative to historical benchmarks has encouraged fund managers to chase returns rather than preserve liquidity. The record‑low cash stance also mirrors a broader sentiment among market participants that the probability of a near‑term correction is limited, prompting them to prioritise capital growth over defensive positioning.

Nevertheless, the thin cash buffer raises questions about market resilience. Historically, higher cash holdings have acted as a shock absorber during periods of heightened volatility, allowing managers to meet redemptions and seize opportunistic buys without forced selling. With cash now roughly half of what managers traditionally retain, the system may be more vulnerable to abrupt shifts in investor sentiment or macro‑economic surprises. A sudden spike in interest rates, an unexpected geopolitical event, or a rapid deterioration in corporate earnings could force managers to liquidate positions at inopportune moments, potentially amplifying market swings.

Analysts caution that while the current environment rewards boldness, prudence remains essential. The record‑low cash level is a clear barometer of confidence, but it also serves as a reminder that market cycles are inherently cyclical. Should the tide turn, the scarcity of liquid assets could constrain the ability of fund managers to navigate turbulence, heightening the risk of forced sales and exacerbating price declines.

In sum, the December 2025 survey paints a picture of an investment community that has largely abandoned the safety net of cash in favour of full‑throttle exposure to equities. The 3.3 % cash ratio, far beneath the 6 % long‑term average, reflects a collective belief in continued market strength. Yet the very thinness of that buffer underscores the fragility of the current bullish consensus and the importance of monitoring liquidity conditions as a leading indicator of potential market stress.
