**The high‑profile meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ended without a peace breakthrough, deepening uncertainty over Ukraine’s reconstruction costs and curbing the optimism that had underpinned 2026 growth forecasts. Analysts now see the war’s economic toll—already measured at roughly $386 billion in lost output and a $486 billion reconstruction bill—pushing projected GDP expansion into a 1‑2.5 % range, far below the 5 %‑plus scenario that hinged on a swift post‑war investment surge. European leaders condemned the prospect of a U.S.–Russia‑centric deal that excludes Kyiv, while equity markets across the continent slipped, reflecting fears of weakened EU cohesion and delayed defence spending.** 

The war’s fiscal devastation is stark. CEPR estimates a 193 % loss of Ukraine’s GDP between 2022 and 2027, translating to about $386 billion of forgone output. The World Bank‑EU‑UN damage assessment places the reconstruction bill at $486 billion—roughly two and a half times the nation’s pre‑war $200 billion economy. By the end of 2023, cumulative damage had already reached $152 billion, and real GDP had contracted by around 20 % in the first year of conflict.

Before the Trump‑Zelenskyy encounter, the most bullish outlook came from the World Bank’s RBC‑Ukraine analysis, which projected a 5.2 % surge in 2026, assuming hostilities would ease by the end of 2025 and unleash a wave of investment. The failed talks have erased that upside. The World Bank’s Kyiv Independent update (23 Dec 2025) now forecasts a flat 2 % growth for both 2025 and 2026, citing the “failure to secure a peace breakthrough” and U.S. pressure on Kyiv to hold a referendum. Dragon Capital has been even more pessimistic, cutting its 2026 outlook to 1 % after Russia’s renewed attacks and the collapse of the energy truce. The Centre for Economic Strategy (CES) places the median 2026 growth at 2.4 % but flags a downside risk that could pull the figure into the 1‑2 % band if the stalemate persists. CEPR warns that any prolonged stalemate will keep growth well below the 4‑5 % range needed for a rapid recovery.

European leaders reacted swiftly and uniformly, demanding that Kyiv be part of any settlement. French President Emmanuel Macron’s office signalled a joint Washington visit with Zelenskyy and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to keep Europe at the centre of any peace process. Starmer himself warned that the UK would not accept a deal negotiated behind Ukraine’s back. German CDU candidate Friedrich Merz cautioned against “confusing the aggressor with the victim,” while EU Commission Vice‑President Kaja Kallas stressed that any agreement must include Ukraine and Europe. NATO Secretary‑General Jens Stoltenberg called a Ukraine‑free settlement a betrayal of Alliance values, and EU Council President Antonio Costa offered a security back‑stop for any credible framework. Hungary’s Viktor Orban was the lone outlier, praising Trump’s hard‑line stance and suggesting that a seat at the negotiating table must be earned.

Financial markets mirrored the diplomatic discord. On 29 Feb 2025, Europe’s equity indices fell: France’s CAC 40 slipped 0.5 % and Germany’s DAX dropped 0.2 %, reflecting investor anxiety that a U.S.‑driven peace push could erode EU cohesion and delay defence‑industry orders. The UK’s FTSE 100 was the only major European gauge to edge higher, up 0.1 %, buoyed by Starmer’s firm commitment to Ukraine. In the United States, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones were essentially flat, their movements muted by broader expectations of Fed rate cuts. Commodities reacted in a classic risk‑on/risk‑off pattern: Brent crude rose 0.8 % on speculation that a stalled peace process would keep Russian oil flowing under existing waivers, while gold ticked up 0.2 % as investors sought safe‑haven assets.

The consensus among forecasters is clear: without a credible, inclusive peace settlement, Ukraine’s economy will struggle to regain momentum, and the reconstruction effort will be financed against a backdrop of subdued growth. European leaders’ insistence on Kyiv’s participation underscores the geopolitical stakes, while the modest market corrections suggest that investors are already pricing in a longer‑term stalemate. The failure of the Trump‑Zelenskyy talks therefore marks not just a diplomatic setback but a tangible drag on Ukraine’s path to recovery.
