**The sharp fall in illegal crossings at the U.S.–Mexico frontier has foregrounded a quieter, often ignored flow – economic migrants who move in search of work rather than refuge. While headline numbers now celebrate a 55‑year low, the underlying labour‑driven migration story remains largely untouched by policy debate.**  

## Defining the “other” migrant  

Economic migrants, sometimes termed labour migrants, are individuals who leave their home country primarily for better employment prospects. They differ from refugees and asylum‑seekers, who flee persecution, war or environmental disaster. The United Nations estimated 164 million international migrants in 2020, of whom roughly 138 million (about 84 %) were economic migrants, while 26 million were classified as refugees or asylum‑seekers.  

## What the latest border data show  

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 238 000 apprehensions of unauthorised border crossers in fiscal year 2025 – the lowest annual total since 1970’s 202 000. This represents a 90 % decline from the 2.2 million encounters logged in FY 2022, the peak of the recent “humanitarian crisis”.  

The composition of those apprehended has shifted. Single adult males now account for 79 % of illegal crossings, up from 63 % a year earlier, while family‑unit encounters fell from 27 % to 12 %. Mexican nationals comprised 40 % of all encounters in FY 2025, a rise from 34 % in the preceding five‑year period, reflecting a re‑balancing towards traditional Mexican migration patterns after years of Central‑American surges.  

## Economic motives behind the numbers  

Despite the headline‑grabbing decline, the proportion of migrants whose primary driver is economic opportunity has not diminished. In the San Diego sector, apprehensions dropped from 14 165 in October 2024 to 960 in October 2025, freeing resources for patrols in remote desert routes traditionally used by seasonal agricultural workers.  

Labour market data from the U.S. Department of Labour show a persistent shortfall of roughly 1 million low‑skill workers in sectors such as agriculture, construction and hospitality. Employers increasingly rely on temporary work visas, yet the rigid quota system and lengthy processing times push many to seek informal entry routes, blurring the line between “legal” and “illegal” economic migration.  

## Policy implications  

The current narrative of “border security success” overlooks the structural demand for migrant labour. A solely enforcement‑focused approach risks creating a chronic underground workforce, vulnerable to exploitation and lacking legal protections. Comprehensive reform should therefore couple robust border management with an expanded, merit‑based temporary work programme that aligns visa allocations with real‑time labour market needs.  

In the absence of such a balanced strategy, the United States may continue to celebrate low apprehension figures while silently subsidising an essential, yet invisible, segment of its economy.
