**Machado’s Risky Gambit in Escaping Venezuela and Relying on Trump**
In a bold and potentially transformative move, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has escaped the country with the help of the United States, openly crediting former President Donald Trump for his administration's "decisive" actions in weakening the Maduro regime. This development marks a significant shift in the historical context of US-Venezuela relations, particularly when compared to the Obama era's approach of diplomatic pressure and targeted sanctions. 

The Obama administration's stance on Venezuela was characterized by a "strategic partnership" that turned hostile after 2014, with a focus on diplomatic pressure and targeted sanctions. In contrast, the Trump administration shifted to a "regime-change" rhetoric and direct military pressure, including airstrikes and naval seizures. Machado's decision to rely on Trump reflects this more confrontational phase of US policy toward Venezuela, which she believes is essential for her and the broader opposition's success. 

Machado's escape, which involved crossing 10 military checkpoints and boarding a fishing boat to Curaçao, was facilitated by a US Special-Forces veteran who coordinated the boat-to-plane extraction. She has publicly thanked President Trump for his administration's actions, which she believes have made the regime "weaker than ever." This move has generated sharp political commentary and a nervous market reaction, with the Venezuelan stock index already down 10% this quarter. 

Reactions from key US politicians have been divided, with Senator Marco Rubio praising the rescue as a "successful rescue" and reiterating US support for a democratic transition in Venezuela. In contrast, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stressed that any solution for Venezuela must be centered on the Venezuelan people and their democratic aspirations, not on the whims of any foreign leader. 

The market response to Machado's escape has been significant, with the Venezuelan IBC index down roughly 10% this quarter, sitting at 1,473 points. This decline reflects heightened political risk and investor wariness after the high-profile escape. The estimated cost of Machado's escape and its impact on Venezuela's already struggling GDP, which has contracted by over 60% since 2013, are still unknown. However, the market move matters, as it highlights the fragility of opposition figures and the possibility of a US-backed regime-change narrative, prompting foreign investors to reduce exposure to Venezuelan equities. 

In conclusion, Machado's decision to rely on Trump is a departure from the Obama-era playbook, reflecting a more aggressive US posture toward Venezuela. While the outcome of this gamble is uncertain, it has already generated significant political and market reactions. As the situation continues to unfold, it is essential to consider the historical context of US-Venezuela relations and the potential implications of this new development.
