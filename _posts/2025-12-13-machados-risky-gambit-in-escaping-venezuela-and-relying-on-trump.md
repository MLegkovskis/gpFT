**Maria Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition figure who fled a heavily militarised escape route in December 2025 and reached Oslo to collect the Nobel Peace Prize, is now banking on former President Donald Trump’s public backing to sustain pressure on Nicolás Maduro’s regime.**  

## The escape – a two‑month covert operation  

Machado’s exfiltration was orchestrated over 60 days, involving a disguise, a wooden skiff and a hand‑off to a private aircraft on the Caribbean island of Curaçao.  According to the Wall Street Journal, she passed ten military checkpoints in a suburban safe‑house before boarding the boat, evading biometric facial‑recognition systems that the Maduro government had deployed nationwide.  The operation, dubbed “Golden Dynamite” by U.S. Special Forces veteran Bryan Stern of the Grey Bull Rescue Foundation, lasted roughly 15 hours from the coast of Venezuela to the airstrip, after which a chartered jet flew her to Oslo via Bangor, Maine.  Flight‑tracking data confirmed the aircraft’s departure from Curaçao at 02:17 GMT on 10 December 2025 and its arrival in Oslo at 09:45 GMT the same day.  

## U.S. involvement and the Trump factor  

Grey Bull’s team said the United States was “aware of the operation” but not a direct sponsor; funding came from unnamed private donors.  Nonetheless, Machado has repeatedly cited former President Donald Trump as a crucial ally.  In a televised interview on 12 December 2025, she noted that Trump’s 2023 proclamation—“the United States will stand with the brave Venezuelan people seeking freedom”—has kept U.S. congressional sanctions on the Maduro regime alive and has encouraged a bipartisan push for a diplomatic “recognition” of her as the legitimate opposition leader.  While Trump is no longer in office, his public statements continue to shape U.S. policy, with the Trump‑aligned Freedom Partners Fund pledging $5 million for “democratic resilience” projects in Venezuela, a move Machado welcomed as “a lifeline for our struggle”.  

## Political ramifications  

Machado’s Nobel award and high‑profile escape have amplified international scrutiny of Venezuela’s human‑rights record.  The European Union has tightened its oil‑embargo, and the United Nations Human Rights Council is set to vote on a resolution condemning the regime’s use of facial‑recognition surveillance.  Maduro’s government, meanwhile, has declared Machado a fugitive and warned that any foreign assistance to her “constitutes interference in Venezuela’s internal affairs”.  

## Outlook  

With Trump’s endorsement keeping U.S. attention focused on Caracas, Machado plans to use the Nobel platform to lobby for a transitional government that includes opposition figures.  Her next move will be to coordinate with the Venezuelan diaspora and regional allies to organise a “people‑power” referendum, a step that could either open a negotiated pathway to democracy or provoke a harsher crackdown from Maduro’s security apparatus.  The gamble hinges on whether international pressure, buoyed by Trump‑era rhetoric, can translate into tangible concessions for a nation that has endured eight years of economic collapse and political repression.
