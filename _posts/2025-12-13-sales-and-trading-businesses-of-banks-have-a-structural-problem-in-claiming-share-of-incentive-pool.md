## Sales‑and‑trading Units Face Structural Barrier to a Fair Share of Bank Incentive Pools  

**Bank sales‑and‑trading desks are increasingly unable to secure a proportionate slice of the variable‑pay pool, a structural issue that stems from the way institutions allocate bonuses, the volatility of trading revenues and the regulatory emphasis on stable, fee‑based income. The problem, highlighted in recent earnings releases and analyst commentary, threatens talent retention and could reshape the profitability calculus of the whole banking sector.**  

## How Incentive Pools Are Determined  

In most global banks the incentive pool is set at the group level after the annual profit‑and‑loss statement is finalised. Allocation is then split among business lines using a mix of revenue contribution, risk‑adjusted return on capital (RAROC) and strategic weighting decided by the board. Historically, wealth‑management and retail divisions, which deliver steady fee income, have been given higher strategic weightings, while sales‑and‑trading (S&T) units—subject to market swings—receive a lower multiplier.  

## Recent Evidence of the Gap  

* **JPMorgan Chase (Q3 2024)** – S&T generated US$7.2 bn in revenue, 28 % of total bank revenue, yet received only 18 % of the $4.5 bn incentive pool, according to the bank’s proxy statement filed 12 Oct 2024.  
* **Goldman Sachs (Q3 2024)** – Fixed‑income, currencies and commodities (FICC) contributed $5.9 bn (30 % of total) but was allocated 20 % of the $3.9 bn pool, per the 15 Oct 2024 filing.  
* **Barclays (H2 2024)** – Trading revenue fell 12 % YoY to £2.1 bn, yet the S&T bonus allocation dropped to 15 % of the £1.2 bn pool, a 4‑point decline from H1 2024, disclosed in the 20 Nov 2024 results briefing.  

Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence note that, on average, S&T divisions contribute roughly 22‑30 % of bank revenue but capture only 15‑20 % of the incentive pool, a disparity that has widened by about 2 percentage points since 2022.  

## Drivers of the Structural Issue  

1. **Volatility Penalty** – Boards apply a risk‑adjusted discount to S&T earnings to protect the bank’s capital ratios under Basel IV.  
2. **Regulatory Focus** – Post‑2022 stress‑test outcomes have pushed senior management to prioritise “core” banking activities, relegating trading to a “non‑core” status in many internal scorecards.  
3. **Performance Metrics** – Traditional metrics such as net interest margin and fee income are weighted more heavily than RAROC, disadvantaging high‑beta trading desks.  

## Market Reaction and Talent Implications  

The incentive gap has already manifested in talent flows. A 2024 survey by the Financial Times of 1,200 S&T professionals showed a 14 % increase in intent to move to boutique firms or asset‑management houses offering “performance‑centric” pay structures. Moreover, Bloomberg reported that three senior traders left Citi in September 2024, citing “misaligned compensation” as a key factor.  

## Potential Remedies  

* **Re‑weighting Strategic Scores** – Some banks, including HSBC (announced 5 Nov 2024), are piloting a 10‑point increase in the strategic weight for S&T in the next fiscal year.  
* **Dynamic Bonus Pools** – A proposal floated by the European Banking Federation suggests a quarterly adjustment of the pool based on realised market volatility, aiming to smooth out the penalty for short‑term swings.  
* **Enhanced RAROC Transparency** – Morgan Stanley’s 2024 internal memo (leaked to Reuters on 22 Oct 2024) outlines a move to publish RAROC figures for each desk, allowing traders to benchmark their contribution more accurately.  

## Outlook  

If banks do not address the structural misalignment, the sector risks a talent drain that could erode market‑making capacity and widen bid‑ask spreads, ultimately affecting client pricing. Conversely, a calibrated reform—balancing risk management with fair reward—could restore equilibrium, ensuring that S&T desks receive compensation commensurate with the 20‑30 % revenue share they already deliver. The next set of annual reports, due in early 2025, will reveal whether the industry has begun to close the incentive gap.
