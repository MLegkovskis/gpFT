**Sales and trading units at major banks are confronting a structural impediment that limits their share of the industry‑wide incentive pool, a problem amplified by shifting revenue mixes and tighter regulatory capital rules.**  

## The incentive pool in context  

Variable pay – bonuses, long‑term incentives and other performance‑linked rewards – remains a core component of total remuneration in investment banks. Historically, sales and trading (S&T) desks have justified a sizeable slice of this pool through high‑frequency revenue generation. Recent industry surveys, however, show S&T’s proportion of total bonus allocations slipping from roughly 30 % in 2018 to just 18‑20 % in 2024 across the Euro‑zone’s top ten banks.  

## Revenue‑mix pressure  

Two trends are eroding S&T’s claim to incentive capital. First, the resurgence of **investment banking (IB)** – driven by robust M&A activity and record‑high underwriting fees – now accounts for an average of 45 % of total operating income, up from 38 % five years ago (data compiled from banks’ annual reports). Second, **asset‑management (AM)** revenues have risen to 30 % of total income, buoyed by fee‑based growth and inflows, further diluting the relative weight of S&T.  

## Regulatory headwinds  

The EU’s **Capital Requirements Directive V (CRD V)** and Basel III reforms have raised the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratios for market‑risk‑weighted assets, compelling banks to allocate more capital to trading books. The resulting cost of capital has trimmed S&T profit margins by an estimated 12‑15 % year‑on‑year, according to a recent analysis by the European Banking Federation.  

## Talent‑retention implications  

With a shrinking bonus share, S&T desks risk a talent drain. A 2024 survey by **eFinancialCareers** found that 42 % of junior traders consider moving to boutique firms or hedge funds, citing “uncompetitive variable pay” as a primary driver. The same poll recorded a 7 % rise in turnover among senior traders compared with 2022 levels.  

## Emerging mitigation strategies  

Banks are experimenting with several corrective measures:  

* **Performance‑aligned bonus formulas** – shifting from revenue‑centric to risk‑adjusted return metrics (e.g., RAROC) to better reflect S&T’s contribution under tighter capital regimes.  
* **Hybrid compensation structures** – blending cash bonuses with deferred equity awards that vest over longer horizons, aligning employee incentives with shareholders’ long‑term interests.  
* **Digital and automation investment** – deploying AI‑driven trading platforms to lower operational costs, thereby freeing up capital that can be redirected to remuneration.  

## Outlook  

Unless banks recalibrate incentive frameworks to acknowledge the altered risk‑return landscape, S&T units may continue to cede ground to IB and AM divisions. The sector’s ability to retain top trading talent and sustain profitability will hinge on how swiftly institutions can integrate risk‑adjusted performance metrics and leverage technology to offset regulatory cost pressures.
