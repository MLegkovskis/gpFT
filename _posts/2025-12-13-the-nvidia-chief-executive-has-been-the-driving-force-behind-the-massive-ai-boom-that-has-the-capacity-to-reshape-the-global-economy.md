**Jensen Huang’s Nvidia sits at the centre of an AI surge that could add trillions to global output, with the company’s GPUs now the default engine for machine‑learning workloads across every major industry.**  

## Nvidia’s meteoric rise  

Since Huang took the helm in 1993, Nvidia has shifted from a niche graphics chip maker to the world’s leading supplier of AI hardware. In the twelve months to 30 April 2024, the firm’s market capitalisation breached the US$1 trillion threshold for the first time, and its share price climbed 540 % from the start of 2023. Revenue for fiscal 2024 rose 23 % year‑on‑year to US$31.0 billion, driven by a 71 % jump in data‑centre sales, now accounting for 45 % of total turnover.  

## AI’s macro‑economic impact  

A McKinsey Global Institute study released in July 2023 estimates that AI could contribute up to US$15.7 trillion to global GDP by 2030, representing a 14 % increase in world economic output. The report highlights that AI‑enabled productivity gains will be most pronounced in manufacturing, health care and financial services – sectors where Nvidia’s GPUs power the underlying models.  

## Huang’s strategic vision  

Huang has repeatedly stressed that Nvidia’s growth hinges on a full stack approach: hardware, software and cloud services. In February 2024 he announced the expansion of the Nvidia EGX edge‑AI platform, targeting real‑time inference in autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT. The same month the company unveiled Omniverse Enterprise, a collaborative simulation environment that already hosts more than 200 corporate users, from aerospace firms to fashion brands.  

## Regulation and responsibility  

At the World Economic Forum in Davos (January 2024), Huang warned that AI regulation should “protect people, not robots”, urging policymakers to focus on transparency, data‑privacy and bias mitigation rather than stifling innovation. His comments echo a broader industry call for standards that balance safety with the rapid deployment of AI solutions.  

## Outlook  

With AI adoption accelerating – IDC projects worldwide AI‑related spending to reach US$500 billion by 2025 – Nvidia’s position as the de‑facto supplier of compute power places it at the heart of the next wave of economic transformation. Analysts at Goldman Sachs now assign a 30 % upside to Nvidia’s 2024 earnings guidance, reflecting confidence that the company will continue to capture a growing share of the AI market.
