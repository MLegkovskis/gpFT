**Nvidia’s chief executive Jensen Huang has become the de‑facto architect of the AI surge that analysts predict could add trillions to global output, with the company’s hardware now underpinning the majority of commercial machine‑learning workloads.**  

## Nvidia’s meteoric growth  

In the second quarter of its 2025 fiscal year (ended 30 April 2024), Nvidia reported revenue of **US$29.0 billion**, a 23 % increase year‑on‑year, and **AI‑related sales accounted for roughly 75 % of that total**.  The share price rose **31 %** since the start of 2024, making it the most valuable US‑listed semiconductor firm.  Huang’s strategy of positioning the company’s data‑centre GPUs as the default engine for large‑scale models has turned Nvidia into a critical supplier for cloud providers, autonomous‑vehicle developers and enterprise AI teams.  

## Economic implications of the AI boom  

A McKinsey Global Institute study released in March 2024 estimates that artificial intelligence could contribute **US$15.7 trillion** to global GDP by 2030, equivalent to a **9 %** uplift in world economic activity.  The International Data Corporation (IDC) projects the worldwide AI market to reach **US$500 billion in 2024**, growing at a **38 % compound annual growth rate** to **US$1.5 trillion by 2030**.  Nvidia’s GPUs are cited in 92 % of the top‑50 AI‑training supercomputers, according to the Top500 list published in June 2024, underscoring the firm’s central role in the supply chain that fuels this expansion.  

## Technological leadership  

Huang’s early bet on the CUDA parallel‑computing platform created a developer ecosystem that now supports more than **30 million** active users, according to Nvidia’s own metrics.  The company’s recent acquisition of **Arm Ltd.** (pending regulatory clearance) is intended to extend AI acceleration into edge devices, potentially lowering the cost of inference by **up to 40 %**.  In addition, the launch of the **H100 Tensor Core GPU** in early 2024 delivered a **2.5‑fold** performance improvement over its predecessor for transformer‑model training, accelerating the rollout of large language models across industries.  

## Outlook and policy considerations  

Analysts at Goldman Sachs project Nvidia’s AI‑related revenue to exceed **US$50 billion** by fiscal 2026, driven by rising demand for generative‑AI services and the rollout of AI‑enhanced enterprise software.  However, the rapid concentration of AI compute capacity raises antitrust and supply‑chain resilience concerns.  European regulators have opened a preliminary review of Nvidia’s market dominance, while the US Department of Commerce is monitoring export controls on high‑performance chips.  

## Huang’s vision  

Huang repeatedly stresses that AI should augment, not replace, human labour, and he has pledged to make the technology “affordable and accessible”.  Through initiatives such as the **Nvidia AI Lab** partnership programme, the firm is funding **over 150** university research projects worldwide, aiming to broaden the talent pipeline that will sustain the sector’s growth.  As the AI wave gathers momentum, Huang’s blend of technical foresight and aggressive market positioning ensures that Nvidia remains the linchpin of an economic transformation that could reshape productivity, employment patterns and global trade over the coming decade.
