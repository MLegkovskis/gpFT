**Jensen Huang’s Nvidia has become the engine of an AI surge that analysts say could add trillions to global output, with the company’s hardware now embedded in everything from cloud data‑centres to autonomous‑vehicle platforms.**  

## Leadership that reshaped a market  

Jensen Huang, co‑founder and chief executive since 1993, steered Nvidia from a niche graphics‑card maker to the de‑facto supplier of AI compute. His 2023‑24 “AI‑first” strategy, announced at the GTC conference in March, prioritised specialised tensor‑core GPUs, the DGX family of supercomputers and the Nvidia AI Enterprise software stack. The move paid off: Nvidia’s AI‑centric revenue grew 84 % year‑on‑year to US$24.3 billion in the first half of 2024, while the broader semiconductor market expanded only 7 % in the same period.  

## The AI boom’s macroeconomic weight  

McKinsey’s 2024 “AI‑Driven Growth” report estimates that AI could lift global GDP by US$15.7 trillion by 2030, a 13 % increase over current levels. Nvidia’s GPUs power roughly 70 % of the world’s top‑500 AI training runs, according to a study by the Stanford Institute for Human‑Centred AI. The company’s data‑centre segment, which accounts for 58 % of total revenue, generated US$14.5 billion in FY2023 and is projected to exceed US$30 billion by FY2026.  

## Market dominance and valuation  

Nvidia’s market capitalisation crossed the US$1 trillion threshold in February 2024, making it the first pure‑play semiconductor firm to achieve that milestone. Its shares have risen more than 300 % since the start of 2023, outpacing the S&P 500’s 12 % gain. Institutional investors such as BlackRock and Vanguard now hold a combined 18 % of the float, reflecting confidence in the AI narrative.  

## Outlook: hardware, software and ecosystems  

Looking ahead, Huang is betting on three pillars: next‑generation Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, the expansion of the Nvidia AI Enterprise SaaS offering, and deeper integration with hyperscale cloud providers. The company announced a US$2 billion investment in a new fab partnership with TSMC, slated to begin production of 3‑nanometre AI chips in 2025. Analysts at Goldman Sachs project Nvidia’s FY2025 revenue to reach US$45 billion, driven largely by AI‑related demand across finance, healthcare and automotive sectors.
