**Jensen Huang has been crowned Financial Times Person of the Year, a recognition that underscores the seismic influence of his AI‑first strategy on both Nvidia’s valuation and the broader technology sector. In the twelve months to December 2025 the former chip‑maker’s share price climbed from $134.26 to $175.02 – a rise of roughly 30 % – while its market capitalisation surged from $3.29 trillion to $4.51 trillion, a gain of more than $1.2 trillion and an increase of around 37 %. The accolade arrives as investors, policymakers and industry peers alike credit Huang’s relentless focus on generative‑AI hardware for reshaping the global economy.** 

The quantitative uplift is striking. Trading‑economics data record a 27.68 % price appreciation over the last year, and the 52‑week range of $86.62 to $212.19 illustrates the volatility that has accompanied Nvidia’s rapid growth. Market‑cap figures from Public.com, StockAnalysis.com, Macrotrends and CompaniesMarketCap all converge on a valuation between $4.26 trillion and $4.51 trillion in early December 2025, confirming a 30‑38 % expansion from the $3.29 trillion level at the close of 2024. 

Three pillars of Huang’s leadership explain the surge. First, the March 2024 unveiling of the Blackwell micro‑architecture positioned Nvidia as the default platform for generative‑AI workloads, prompting a wave of data‑centre orders that sustained the share‑price rally through 2024‑2025. Second, strategic multi‑year supply contracts secured with Microsoft, Amazon and Google in the second quarter of 2025 broadened the addressable market for the H100 and upcoming Blackwell GPUs, translating technical advantage into recurring revenue streams. Third, the company’s FY 2025 earnings – $130.5 billion in revenue, a 45 % year‑on‑year jump – were repeatedly linked by analysts to Huang’s “relentless focus on AI‑first product development”. 

Investor confidence has been further bolstered by Huang’s public statements. In a 2025 Bloomberg interview he declared that Nvidia is “building the compute fabric that will power every AI model for the next decade”, a line that analysts cite as a catalyst for the sustained 30 % share‑price gain and the roughly 35 % market‑cap expansion. The market’s response has been swift: by 12 December 2025 the stock closed at $175.02, its highest level since the October 2025 peak of $212.19, while the company’s valuation now places it among the world’s most valuable public firms. 

Beyond the numbers, Huang’s elevation to Person of the Year signals a broader shift. The technology sector, once a peripheral driver of growth, now sits at the heart of global economic policy discussions, with AI hardware supply chains and data‑centre capacity becoming matters of national strategic importance. By turning Nvidia into a trillion‑dollar engine of AI innovation, Huang has not only rewarded shareholders but also reshaped the competitive landscape for governments and enterprises worldwide. 

The FT’s choice therefore reflects more than corporate success; it marks the moment when a single technologist’s vision has translated into tangible economic power, redefining the parameters of influence in a decade dominated by artificial intelligence.
