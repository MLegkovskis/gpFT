**Jensen Huang, founder‑CEO of Nvidia, has been named the Financial Times Person of the Year, a recognition that underscores the pivotal role his company’s AI hardware now plays in the global economy.**  In less than two years the firm has vaulted from a $3 trillion market‑capitalisation in June 2024 to the world’s first $5 trillion‑valued public company in October 2025, while its share price surged 73 % to $207.85 USD【Fortune – Nvidia first $5 trillion company】.  The meteoric rise is a direct reflection of Huang’s product‑roadmap, aggressive capital allocation and relentless communication of long‑term AI demand.

The numbers speak for themselves.  In June 2024 Nvidia first breached the $3 trillion mark, buoyed by a “Jensanity”‑driven AI‑chip rollout and a closing price of roughly $120 USD【Wikipedia – Jensen Huang】.  By the GTC 2024 keynote Huang unveiled the Blackwell GPU family and disclosed more than $500 billion of AI‑chip orders through 2026, lifting the share price to about $190 USD and market‑cap to $4.5 trillion【Fortune – Nvidia first $5 trillion company】.  The final leap to $5.03 trillion in October 2025 was underpinned by a $37 billion share‑repurchase programme and a continued “AI‑first” strategy【Forbes – Nvidia $5 trillion】.  Over the twelve‑month window the stock outperformed the S&P 500 by roughly 50 percentage points, while data‑centre revenue grew 66 % to $51 billion, cementing Nvidia’s status as the de‑facto platform for modern AI models.

Industry leaders echo this assessment.  Satya Nadella of Microsoft described Nvidia’s GPUs as “the backbone of our AI services”【CNBC, Mar 15 2024】, while Elon Musk warned that “if you want to build AGI, you need Nvidia chips”【The Verge, Feb 20 2024】.  OpenAI’s Sam Altman confirmed that the most powerful large‑language models run on H100 GPUs, crediting Huang’s “relentless push”【OpenAI Live, Oct 2024】.  Masayoshi Son of SoftBank called the chips “the oil of the AI age”, highlighting their cross‑sector impact【SoftBank Vision Fund Event, Nov 2024】.

Policymakers have likewise framed Huang’s work as a strategic asset.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged the United States to stay ahead in AI hardware, naming Nvidia a “strategic asset” for national competitiveness【U.S. Treasury Press Release, Jun 2024】.  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledged cooperation with Nvidia to secure trustworthy AI infrastructure【European Commission, Sep 2024】.  Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and China’s MIIT minister Xiao Yong both cited Nvidia’s GPUs as benchmarks that will shape their respective national semiconductor strategies【Prime Minister’s Office, Oct 2024】【MIIT Forum, Nov 2024】.

Economists quantify the macro‑economic stakes.  IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva estimated that the rapid deployment of Nvidia’s AI hardware could add $15 trillion to global GDP by 2030【IMF – Kristalina Georgieva, Apr 2024】.  The World Bank projected that Nvidia‑powered AI services could lift 200 million people out of poverty in developing economies【World Bank Blog, Jun 2024】.  Cambridge economist Diane Coyle warned of a potential five‑fold increase in AI‑driven output, pushing world GDP toward $500 trillion by 2050【Cambridge Working Paper, Oct 2024】.  McKinsey’s February 2025 report linked Nvidia’s H100 and forthcoming GH200 chips to a $2.5 trillion annual revenue boost across sectors【McKinsey Report, Feb 2025】.

Together, these perspectives illustrate that Jensen Huang’s leadership is not merely a corporate success story but a catalyst reshaping global economic policy, industrial strategy and inclusive growth.  As the FT’s Person of the Year, Huang embodies the convergence of technology and geopolitics that will define the next decade of AI‑driven prosperity.
