**Warner Bros Discovery has signalled it will advise shareholders to reject Paramount’s $108.4 bn hostile bid, preferring to press ahead with its already‑signed Netflix partnership.** The all‑cash tender offer, launched on 8 December 2025 at $30 per share, would have combined the Warner film, television and news assets with Paramount‑Skydance’s portfolio, creating a media behemoth valued at roughly £81 bn. Board members cited financing uncertainty, regulatory risk and the belief that the company could achieve greater value on its own. 

Paramount’s financing plan relied on $41 bn of equity from the Ellison family, Redbird Capital and other investors, plus $54 bn of debt pledged by Bank of America, Citi and Apollo Global Management. The structure collapsed when Affinity Partners, the firm led by Jared Kushner, withdrew its support on 16 December 2025, describing a shift in investment dynamics. Analysts quickly reassessed Warner Bros Discovery’s fair value, lifting estimates from $22.30 to $24.10 per share, and maintaining buy ratings with target prices near $27. 

The rejection has been welcomed by industry commentators. Morgan Stanley’s media‑sector team argued that turning down the bid leaves Warner Bros Discovery in a stronger negotiating position with Netflix and preserves market balance for rivals such as Disney and Universal. Goldman Sachs echoed the sentiment, noting that the premium offered by Paramount – a modest 3 % over the closing price – failed to compensate for the debt‑laden financing and antitrust hurdles. 

Disney’s chief executive, Bob Iger, stressed the importance of strategic partnerships over pure cash transactions, while Universal Pictures chair Donna Langley warned that a combined Paramount‑Warner entity would have reshaped the competitive landscape, prompting Universal to monitor the situation closely. No counter‑offers have emerged, and Warner Bros Discovery continues discussions on its $72 bn (≈ $54 bn GBP) deal with Netflix, which promises a more stable revenue stream without the regulatory cloud of a mega‑merger. 

The scale of Paramount’s proposal dwarfs the most comparable historic transaction. In 1994, Viacom’s acquisition of Paramount Communications – a friendly cash‑plus‑stock merger – closed at $10.5 bn, roughly one‑tenth the value of the 2025 bid. That earlier deal, announced in February 1994 and completed in July, was financed entirely from Viacom’s balance sheet and required only modest antitrust concessions. By contrast, the 2025 offer is hostile, leverages $54 bn of new debt, and would have merged two of the world’s largest content creators, broadcasters and news organisations, raising profound competition concerns. 

The divergent outcomes underscore how the media landscape has evolved. The 1994 merger created a $10‑bn conglomerate that survived as a dominant force, while today’s proposed $108 bn combination threatens to concentrate too much power in a single entity, prompting both regulators and shareholders to demand higher premiums and clearer financing. Warner Bros Discovery’s decision to reject the bid reflects a broader industry trend: companies are increasingly valuing strategic alliances and streaming partnerships over sprawling, debt‑heavy takeovers that could trigger antitrust scrutiny. 

As the year draws to a close, the battle for control of Hollywood’s premier content libraries remains unresolved. Paramount will likely revisit its strategy, perhaps seeking a more palatable, less leveraged approach, while Warner Bros Discovery leans on its Netflix alliance to bolster cash flow and shareholder returns. The episode serves as a reminder that size alone does not guarantee approval; financial prudence, regulatory acceptance and strategic fit remain the decisive factors in today’s media M&A arena.
