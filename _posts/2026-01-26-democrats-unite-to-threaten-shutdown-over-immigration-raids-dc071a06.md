### Democrats Unite to Threaten Shutdown Over Immigration Raids
The Democratic Party is threatening a partial government shutdown over immigration raids, demanding reforms to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The party is seeking to add guardrails to the DHS funding bill, including warrants for all immigration arrests and mandatory training for ICE agents.

The shutdown threat is a targeted political lever that aligns with the Democratic Party's immigration agenda. By withholding funding for ICE and risking a partial shutdown, Democrats aim to force the administration to re-structure ICE, add accountability mechanisms, and curb aggressive raids.

Key Democratic lawmakers, including Senators Chris Murphy, Alex Padilla, and Jacky Rosen, have publicly announced their opposition to the DHS funding bill unless reforms are added. The party is also introducing legislation, such as the 'Melt ICE Act', to defund ICE's detention system and redirect funds to community-repair programs.

The proposed shutdown plan is not a generic budget dispute; it is a concrete application of the Democratic Party's immigration policy goals. By threatening to withhold $10 billion earmarked for ICE and risking a partial shutdown that could affect $1.3 trillion in federal spending, Democrats are demanding major reforms to DHS/ICE, increased oversight, and an end to aggressive raids – core elements of their stated immigration policy goals.
