**AI debt boom pushes US corporate bond sales close to record**

US investment‑grade corporate bond issuance has surged to $1.7 trillion in 2025, a level that mirrors the pandemic‑era peak of 2020. The Bloomberg‑compiled data released on 23 December 2025 shows the market returning to its historic high as firms tap debt to fund artificial‑intelligence projects. The figure places the current year on a collision course with the all‑time record set during the Covid‑driven surge, underscoring the scale of the AI‑fuelled financing wave.

The resurgence is not merely a statistical footnote; it reflects a structural shift in corporate capital strategy. Companies are borrowing heavily to secure AI talent, build data‑centres and integrate machine‑learning tools across operations. The appetite for such financing is evident in the headline‑grabbing order book for Meta’s recent offering. On 30 October, the social‑media giant attracted $125 billion of peak orders for a $30 billion bond issue – the largest corporate order flow ever recorded, according to Investment News. That single transaction illustrates how AI‑centric firms are commanding unprecedented investor interest, driving up both issuance volumes and pricing dynamics.

The 2025 total matches the $1.7 trillion issuance that defined 2020, a year when companies turned to the bond market in response to pandemic‑induced uncertainty. MarketWatch’s 2021 analysis of Dealogic data confirmed that 2020 remains the benchmark for US corporate bond supply. The present‑day parity suggests that the AI‑driven debt boom has recreated the conditions of that earlier surge, albeit with a different catalyst. While the pandemic prompted firms to shore up balance sheets against economic shock, the AI wave is motivated by a strategic race to embed advanced technologies and maintain competitive advantage.

Analysts see both opportunity and risk in the current environment. The sheer scale of issuance indicates confidence among investors that AI will deliver long‑term returns, yet the concentration of capital in a handful of mega‑issuers raises questions about market depth and pricing resilience. Should the anticipated productivity gains fail to materialise, the elevated debt levels could strain corporate cash flows, especially if interest rates rise. Conversely, successful AI integration could enhance earnings, justifying the elevated leverage and reinforcing the bond market’s appetite for further supply.

Looking ahead, the trajectory of US corporate bond sales will hinge on the pace of AI adoption and the broader macro‑economic backdrop. If the sector continues to generate robust cash‑flow upgrades, the market may finally eclipse the 2020 record, setting a new high‑water mark for corporate financing. For now, the $1.7 trillion figure stands as a testament to the potency of AI as a financing driver, bringing the bond market back to its most prolific era.
