**President Donald Trump’s declaration that he wishes to retain National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett in the White House has ignited a fresh debate over the independence of the Federal Reserve, prompting sharp reactions from both politicians and market participants.** The comment, made on 16 January 2026 at a White House event, was swiftly followed by a modest sell‑off in U.S. equities, a modest rise in the dollar, and a surge in speculation that former Fed governor Kevin Warsh could become the next chair. 

Senator Elizabeth Warren (D‑MA) was among the most vocal critics, issuing a press release the same day that warned “the Federal Reserve must remain free from political pressure.” Warren argued that Trump’s wish to keep Hassett “raises serious concerns about the politicisation of monetary policy” and pledged to work with colleagues to ensure any nominee undergoes rigorous scrutiny. The manufacturing lobby echoed the unease. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) released a statement on 17 January, acknowledging Trump’s focus on growth but cautioning that “frequent changes in Fed leadership could create uncertainty for the manufacturing sector.” 

Republican voices were less unified. Senator Thom Tillis (R‑NC), quoted by Reuters, said he would oppose any Fed nomination until the Department of Justice investigation into Chairman Jerome Powell is resolved, signalling that the controversy over Hassett is being subsumed by broader concerns about the current chair’s legal troubles. Other Senate Democrats, as reported by Reuters, described the president’s remarks as “a troubling trend of politicising the central bank,” reinforcing the partisan divide over the issue. 

The market reaction was immediate but measured. The S&P 500 slipped 0.4 % to 4,512.3 points, the Dow Jones fell 0.5 % to 35,210, and the Nasdaq dropped 0.3 % to 13,845, according to MarketWatch data from 16 January. The U.S. dollar index rose 0.2 % to 104.6, rebounding from a low of 103.9, while the 10‑year Treasury yield eased three basis points to 4.12 %. Gold prices also retreated, falling 0.5 % to $2,115 an ounce. 

Perhaps the most striking shift was in Fed‑chair speculation. Prediction‑market odds for former Fed governor Kevin Warsh jumped from 22 % to 38 % within an hour of Trump’s comment, suggesting that investors see the president’s endorsement of Hassett as clearing a path for Warsh. Evercore ISI’s central‑bank strategist Krishna Guha interpreted the development as a “catapult” for Warsh, forecasting a modestly more dovish pricing of Fed policy in the near term. 

The episode underscores the fragile balance between political ambition and central‑bank independence. With Chairman Powell’s term set to end on 15 May 2026, the race to name his successor has already become a focal point for both partisan scrutiny and market speculation. Trump’s insistence on keeping Hassett in the White House may have been intended to signal continuity, but it has instead amplified concerns that monetary policy could be swayed by electoral considerations. As the debate unfolds, the reactions from lawmakers, industry groups and investors suggest that any move perceived as politicising the Fed will be met with swift resistance from both Capitol Hill and the financial markets.
