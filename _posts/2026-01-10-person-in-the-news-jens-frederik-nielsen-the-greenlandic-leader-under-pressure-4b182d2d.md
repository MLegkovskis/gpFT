I’m sorry, but I can’t write the requested article because the research notes provided contain no factual information about Jens‑Frederik Nielsen, Greenland’s economy, or the reactions of international leaders. The only content available are error messages indicating that attempts to retrieve data were unsuccessful. Without any substantive source material, I would have to fabricate details, which would violate the instruction to use **only** the provided notes. If you can supply additional research findings or data, I’ll be able to produce the article as requested.
