**Apollo’s bearish software view with bets against corporate debt has sparked a split among private‑equity lenders, with rivals Blackstone and KKR downplaying the risk while industry analysts see the move as a tactical hedge rather than a sector‑wide warning.**  

Apollo Global Management quietly began short‑selling senior loans of a handful of high‑growth software firms it deems “AI‑vulnerable”, including Internet Brands, SonicWall and Perforce, and trimmed its broader exposure to software‑sector credit. The positions amount to less than 1 % of Apollo’s $700 billion credit portfolio – roughly $7 billion at most – but the high‑visibility nature of the bet has drawn keen interest from competitors and market commentators【Financial Times – Apollo took bearish software view with bets against corporate debt】.  

Apollo insiders argue that generative‑AI could erode cash‑flow stability for firms heavily reliant on rapid growth, creating a “material upside‑risk to the credit profile” of such borrowers【Financial Times】. The short positions were taken as a risk‑management hedge, not a wholesale exit from software credit. After a period of volatility, the targeted loans have recovered, now trading above 80 cents on the dollar, easing immediate stress concerns【Cryptopolitan】.  

Rival investors have responded in markedly different ways. Blackstone, which participated alongside Apollo and KKR in a UK private‑credit stress test, signalled that it is monitoring systemic risk but has kept its software‑credit exposure modest – about $323 million across 18 deals in 2024【The Paypers】【FounderPath】. Its involvement in the stress test suggests a cautious, data‑driven approach rather than a bearish stance.  

KKR, by contrast, holds a direct exposure to Internet Brands – one of the companies Apollo has shorted – yet its public commentary emphasises “robust underwriting standards and diversified credit exposure”, implicitly distancing itself from Apollo’s tactical short‑sell【Longbridge】. KKR’s broader portfolio remains diversified, and the firm has not echoed Apollo’s concerns about AI‑driven earnings pressure.  

Analysts at Bain & Company note that multisector PE firms such as Blackstone, KKR and TPG continue to expand software‑focused private‑credit, having raised $270 billion in tech funds since 2016. They warn that AI‑related earnings pressure could compress spreads, but deep‑pocketed lenders can absorb short‑term volatility【Bain】. A sub‑stack comparison highlights that Apollo’s insurance‑asset‑backed capital model is more concentrated than the diversified platforms of Blackstone and KKR, making its sector‑specific exposure proportionally larger【Rock and Turner】.  

The timeline underscores the rapid evolution of the debate. Apollo’s short‑sell was first reported in October 2023, the loan prices rebounded by February 2024, and the joint UK stress‑test involving Blackstone and KKR was announced in March 2024【FT; Cryptopolitan; The Paypers】.  

**Bottom line:** Apollo’s bearish bet is narrow in scale but high‑profile, aimed at software firms it believes are vulnerable to AI disruption. Blackstone and KKR are not echoing this view; they are either participating in systemic stress‑testing or stressing disciplined underwriting and diversified exposure. Industry observers interpret Apollo’s move as a tactical hedge rather than a harbinger of a broader software‑debt downturn.
