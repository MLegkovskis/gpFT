**But not because of anything to do with the US transport secretary’s campaign to civilise air travel**

The United States airline sector is enjoying a modest rebound in passenger demand, buoyed by a 3.8 percent annualised rise in real GDP in the second quarter of 2025 – a turnaround from a 0.6 percent contraction in the previous quarter. Consumer‑spending growth, especially on transportation services, has lifted the economy to its strongest quarterly pace since the third quarter of 2023, while investment and export activity remain subdued. The macro‑environment, rather than the Department of Transportation’s newly‑launched “Golden Age of Travel” civility drive, is the primary engine behind the sector’s recent performance.

The DOT’s campaign, announced on 6 November 2025 by Secretary of Transportation Sean P. Duffy, frames a return to courteous behaviour as a safety and efficiency measure. Duffy’s remarks – urging passengers to “be nice, say ‘please,’ say ‘thank you’” and to dress appropriately – are couched in the language of modernising the air‑space system and unlocking capacity. A Department spokesperson echoed this cultural narrative, suggesting that reduced disruptions could lower operating costs. Yet the initiative makes no explicit claim of immediate financial benefit.

Analysts at Morgan Morgan & Co. were swift to temper expectations. In comments to Reuters on 7 November, analyst Karen Lee warned that the campaign would have “no material impact on top‑line growth this year,” with any upside limited to indirect gains from lower disruption costs or a modest lift in ancillary revenue if passengers feel more comfortable. A follow‑up note on 8 November reinforced the view that earnings would remain unchanged in the near term, though improved passenger‑satisfaction metrics could feed into longer‑term forecasts.

Market reaction was equally muted. United Airlines closed at $48.73, up 0.3 percent; Delta at $55.12, up 0.1 percent; and American at $19.84, up 0.2 percent. The S&P 500 Transportation Index rose 0.2 percent – movements well within the sector’s typical daily volatility and not attributed to the civility push. The consensus among pilots and historians interviewed by Newsweek was that behavioural nudges cannot overcome structural pressures. Veteran pilot Stephanie Wallach dismissed the campaign as “too late,” while historian Dan Bubb highlighted that seat density and pricing, rather than etiquette, drive incivility.

The backdrop to these debates is a stark rise in in‑flight disturbances. FAA data, cited by Fox Business, show a more than 400 percent increase in such incidents since 2019, with thousands of cases reported annually and enforcement actions climbing sharply since 2021. Nevertheless, the sheer volume of travel – a record 81.8 million U.S. travellers projected for Thanksgiving 2025, up 1.6 million on the previous year – suggests that demand fundamentals, rather than passenger manners, dominate airline performance.

In sum, the transport secretary’s civility campaign is a cultural experiment that has yet to translate into measurable earnings or stock‑price movement. The sector’s current trajectory is driven by broader economic recovery and robust travel demand, while the long‑term impact of behavioural initiatives remains uncertain.
