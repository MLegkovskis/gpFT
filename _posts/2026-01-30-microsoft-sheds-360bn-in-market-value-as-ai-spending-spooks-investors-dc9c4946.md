Microsoft's recent announcement of significant AI-related expenditures has led to a substantial decline in its market value, with a staggering $360bn wiped out. The company's record-high capital expenditures of $37.5bn in the second quarter of FY 2025, representing a 66% year-over-year increase, have raised concerns among investors about the potential impact on cash flow and margins. Furthermore, the concentration risk associated with the company's partnership with OpenAI, which accounts for approximately 45% of Microsoft's backlog, has added to the uncertainty. The massive data-center build-out, while aimed at expanding AI infrastructure, has also created capacity constraints, potentially throttling revenue growth. As a result, investors have become increasingly cautious, leading to a decline in Microsoft's share price and a subsequent loss in market value.
