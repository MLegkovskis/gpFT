**London’s food and hospitality sector generated a record £46 billion in 2023, accounting for roughly 7 % of the capital’s GDP and supporting around 120 000 jobs, while Dame Prue Leith’s curated list of eateries and food‑shopping venues offers a living map of the city’s culinary evolution from post‑war modesty to today’s multi‑sensory, heritage‑plus‑innovation scene.** 

The £46 bn revenue figure places hospitality among London’s top‑five economic contributors, outpacing the national growth rate with an average monthly increase of 7.7 % versus 5.6 % across the UK. The sector’s magnetism is evident in the extra 850 000 visitors drawn by the city’s pubs, bars and restaurants, who added an estimated £360 m to the local economy. Tax receipts from hospitality total roughly £150 m, feeding both municipal and national coffers, while the industry sustains about 120 000 London jobs – roughly 2.6 % of total employment. The Mayor of London has hailed this performance as “phenomenal resilience”, underscoring the sector’s role as a driver of post‑pandemic recovery.

Leith’s own journey mirrors that transformation. In 1969 she opened Leith’s in Notting Hill, a modest modern‑British restaurant that went on to win a Michelin star in 1979 – the first such accolade for a London venue outside the traditional club circuit. The success signalled a shift toward chef‑driven, independent dining that broke the monopoly of hotel and private‑members’ clubs. Her 1975 founding of Leith’s School of Food and Wine professionalised culinary training, creating a pipeline of chefs who would later populate the city’s burgeoning fine‑dining and casual‑eating sectors.

The 1990s and early 2000s saw global flavours infiltrate London’s menus, a change Leith captures in her reflection that food of thirty years ago was “lumpy, clumsy and ugly”, whereas today diners encounter “precision plating” and “global flavour mash‑ups”. This aesthetic leap is evident in the multi‑sensory presentations she describes – powders, smudges, lollipops of parmesan – that now sit alongside classic British dishes.

Leith’s endorsement of street food as “the revolution of food” acknowledges the sector’s catalytic role in recent years. The rise of food‑trucks, pop‑up stalls and delivery platforms such as Uber Eats has democratised innovation, allowing experimental concepts to reach a mass audience before graduating to permanent premises. Her judging of the inaugural Uber Eats Restaurant Awards in 2023 highlights the mainstream acceptance of this once‑marginal format.

Her favourite dining and shopping spots illustrate how London blends heritage with hyper‑local dynamism. Bentley’s Oyster Bar, founded in 1916 and praised by Leith as an “absolutely wonderful restaurant”, survived two world wars and the West End’s 1970s decline, now thriving as a heritage‑plus‑modern venue. The four food‑shopping locations she recommends – Borough Market, Fortnum & Mason’s Royal Food Hall, The Cheese Bar in Camden, and Maltby Street Market – span centuries. Fortnum & Mason, a 1707 institution, sits alongside the 2011‑launched Maltby Street Market, a compact community‑driven space that feels like a 19th‑century street fair. Together they embody a layered ecosystem where provenance, sustainability and novelty coexist.

Leith’s personal timeline – from opening her restaurant in 1969, founding a culinary school in 1975, witnessing the first Michelin star for an independent London eatery in 1979, to championing street‑food innovation in 2023 – runs parallel to the city’s metamorphosis from post‑war austerity to a globally‑renowned, multicultural food capital. Her curated list is more than a personal guide; it is a micro‑snapshot of London’s culinary narrative, where historic venues are re‑imagined for contemporary palates, chef‑driven fine dining coexists with street‑level creativity, and a renewed focus on artisanal production underpins the city’s food‑shopping landscape.

In sum, the sector’s £46 bn economic footprint and Leith’s celebrated endorsements together illustrate a virtuous cycle: robust economic performance fuels culinary experimentation, while visionary chefs and food‑culture advocates like Leith help translate that prosperity into a vibrant, ever‑evolving dining scene that continues to attract visitors, create jobs and reinforce London’s status as a world food capital.
