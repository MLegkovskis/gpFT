**China investment falls for third successive month, with foreign direct inflows plunging 13.2 % year‑on‑year** – the Ministry of Commerce confirmed that inbound capital in the January‑May 2025 window slumped sharply, marking the third month in a row that overall investment contracted. The decline is evident across the three pillars of fixed‑asset investment – property, infrastructure and manufacturing – and signals the deepest multi‑month slump since the pandemic‑induced downturn of 2020.

The latest National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) releases show fixed‑asset investment (FAI) falling by 12.0 % YoY in October, 9.3 % in November and 7.8 % in December 2025. Month‑on‑month figures confirm a steady erosion, with declines of 1.62 % in October, 1.05 % in November and 0.88 % in December. Property investment led the slide, down 14.7 % YoY, while infrastructure barely moved, slipping 0.1 % and manufacturing posted a modest 2.7 % gain for the year to date. The cumulative three‑month YoY contraction averages roughly 9.7 %, a magnitude four to five times larger than the steepest quarterly drop recorded during the 2008‑09 global financial crisis.

In the 2008‑09 episode, China’s FAI slipped only 0.5 % YoY in the fourth quarter of 2008 – the first annual decline in over a decade – and deepened to 2.5 % YoY in the first quarter of 2009. The downturn was swiftly countered by a RMB 4 trillion stimulus package launched in November 2008, which propelled a 13.5 % YoY surge in the second quarter of 2009. By contrast, Beijing’s response in 2025 has been measured. A modest fiscal stimulus was announced in October, aimed at curbing overcapacity rather than flooding the economy with infrastructure spending. The “anti‑involution” campaign underscores a reluctance to repeat the massive stimulus of a decade ago.

The breadth of the current contraction is notable. All three major components of investment are contracting simultaneously – a rarity not seen since the early COVID‑19 shock. In 2008‑09, the stimulus re‑balanced the mix toward infrastructure, lifting that sector sharply. The 2025 slump, however, reflects a more systemic slowdown, with property, infrastructure and manufacturing all under pressure. Analysts point to lingering uncertainties in global demand, tighter credit conditions and a cautious policy stance as key drivers.

The foreign direct investment plunge adds another layer of concern. A 13.2 % YoY fall in the January‑May period signals waning confidence among overseas investors, who have traditionally viewed China as a stable destination for long‑term capital. The Ministry of Commerce’s data, released in July, underscores the persistence of the trend, as the country records its third consecutive month of overall investment contraction.

Historical context places the 2025 slump as the most severe post‑COVID contraction. The last comparable multi‑month decline occurred in June 2020, when FAI fell 1.7 % YoY. The current trajectory, with an average near 10 % YoY over three months, eclipses that benchmark and suggests a protracted period of adjustment for China’s investment‑driven growth model.

Looking ahead, the scale of the downturn may compel Beijing to reconsider its policy mix. While the current approach favours targeted measures over broad fiscal stimulus, the depth and breadth of the slump could pressure policymakers to adopt a more expansive stance if growth continues to falter. For now, the data paints a picture of an economy grappling with a rare, multi‑sectoral investment contraction, a stark departure from the stimulus‑fuelled recoveries of the past.
