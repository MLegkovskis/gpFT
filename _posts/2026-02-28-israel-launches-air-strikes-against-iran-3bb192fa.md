# Israel Launches Air Strikes Against Iran
The Israeli military has conducted air strikes against Iranian nuclear and military sites, sparking a mix of reactions from the international community.
## International Reaction
The United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany have expressed support for Israel's right to self-defense, while also calling for restraint and diplomatic de-escalation. Russia and China have condemned the strikes as violations of international law, and have opposed a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire.
## Regional Implications
The situation has the potential to escalate into a wider conflict, with implications for regional stability and global security. Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel, and Iran has signalled readiness to strike Israeli civilian targets and US assets in the region.
## Economic Impact
The conflict could also have economic implications, with the potential to disrupt oil markets and push prices higher.
## Diplomatic Efforts
The upcoming Iran-IAEA meeting may provide a diplomatic outlet, but the situation remains volatile and unpredictable.
