**Donald Trump’s latest declaration that “We have to have Greenland” has reignited a diplomatic flashpoint that first flared in 2019, prompting Denmark and Greenland’s self‑governing authorities to reaffirm the inviolability of their sovereignty and to mobilise a substantial Arctic defence response.** The President’s Truth Social post on 20 December 2025 was immediately followed by the appointment of Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as a “special envoy” for Greenland, a move denounced by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Minister for Foreign Affairs Jens‑Frederik Nielsen as a breach of international law. Denmark has since pledged an extra US $2 billion for Arctic defence, while Greenland’s parliament is drafting legislation to bar foreign political funding, underscoring the region’s resolve against external interference.

Trump’s remark echoes his earlier 2019 overture, when he floated a US $100 billion purchase of the island. At the time, Frederiksen dismissed the notion as “absurd” and stressed that Greenland was “not for sale”. A contemporaneous poll revealed that roughly 85 % of Greenlandic adults opposed any U.S. acquisition, a sentiment that remains entrenched. The President’s recent wording—identical to his 2019 phrasing—was posted on a Sunday and quickly amplified by U.S. media, prompting a swift diplomatic response.

On 22 December 2025, Frederiksen issued a joint statement with Greenlandic Premier Múte Bourup Egede and Minister Nielsen, reiterating that “national borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law”. Nielsen warned unequivocally that “you cannot annex another country. Not even with an argument about international security”, while Egede dismissed the U.S. move as having “no practical effect” on Greenland’s internal affairs. The coordinated rebuttal highlighted a shared Nordic stance that any attempt at annexation would be illegal and untenable.

In parallel, Denmark’s Ministry of Defence announced a US $2 billion augmentation to its Arctic defence budget, a direct reaction to the heightened U.S. interest. The funds are earmarked for modernising naval and air capabilities in the High North, reinforcing Denmark’s capacity to protect its sovereign territories, including Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Meanwhile, the Greenlandic Parliament (Inatsisartut) is drafting a law to prohibit foreign political funding, a legislative safeguard aimed at curbing perceived U.S. influence and preserving democratic autonomy.

The episode underscores the strategic importance of Greenland in the evolving geopolitics of the Arctic. While the United States seeks to bolster its security posture amid rising great‑power competition, the Nordic bloc remains steadfast in defending the principle that territorial acquisition cannot be achieved through unilateral declarations or diplomatic appointments. The Danish‑Greenlandic response, bolstered by a sizeable defence investment and legislative measures, signals a clear message: sovereignty will not be negotiated away, and any future overtures will be met with firm legal and political resistance.

The latest diplomatic row also revives historical attempts to purchase Greenland, notably the 1946 U.S. proposal and the 1867 Danish sale of the island to the United States, both of which were rebuffed. The persistence of such ambitions, despite repeated rejections, reflects the enduring allure of Greenland’s mineral wealth, strategic location, and potential as a gateway to the Arctic. Yet, as the 2025 reactions demonstrate, contemporary international norms and regional solidarity are reshaping the calculus, ensuring that Greenland’s future remains firmly in the hands of its own people and their Nordic partners.
