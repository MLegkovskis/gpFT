# EU Prepares to Retaliate Against US Tariffs
The European Union is preparing to retaliate against the United States over new tariffs imposed by President Trump, with a focus on a 10% flat global tariff. France's trade minister, Nicolas Forissier, has stated that the EU has the necessary tools to respond, including the Anti-Coercion Instrument and a suspended package of retaliatory tariffs on over €90 billion of US goods.
## Role of the European Commission
The European Commission will play a key role in coordinating the EU's response, including drafting retaliatory measures and implementing existing tools such as safeguard measures and the Anti-Coercion Instrument. The Commission will also act as a diplomatic liaison, seeking clarity from the US administration on the next steps they intend to take.
## Potential Retaliation
The EU's potential retaliation could target approximately €8 billion worth of US-origin goods with duties of 10-25%. The Commission has also established an Import Surveillance Task Force to collect evidence and support the development of other EU policy responses.
