Israel has around 170,000 active-duty personnel, with main bases in Tel Nof, Nevatim, and Palmachim. The United Arab Emirates has around 5,000-7,000 troops, with US-hosted personnel at Al Mithaq in Abu Dhabi.
## Key Alliances
The region is seeing the formation of new alliances, including the Israel-UAE Strategic-Security Partnership and the Trilateral Action Plan between Israel, Greece, and Cyprus. The Saudi-UAE "Arab Shield" and the Iran-Russia-China "Strategic Axis" are also notable alliances in the region.
## Expected Shifts
In the coming months, the region is expected to see a normalization of the US military posture, with the USS *Abraham Lincoln* carrier strike group remaining on station for at least 90 days. Israel and the UAE are also expected to deepen their operational ties, with joint air-defence drills and maritime interdiction exercises scheduled monthly through Q2 2026.

The US has a significant military presence in the region, while Russia is providing military support to Iran and Syria. European nations, including France, Germany, and the UK, are also involved in the region, with a focus on preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
## Conclusion
