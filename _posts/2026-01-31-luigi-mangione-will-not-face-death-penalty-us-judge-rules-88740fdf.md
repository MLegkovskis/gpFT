### Luigi Mangione Will Not Face Death Penalty, US Judge Rules
A US judge has ruled that Luigi Mangione, the 27-year-old accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, will not face the death penalty. The decision was made by US District Judge Margaret Garnett, who dismissed two of the four federal counts against Mangione, including murder through use of a firearm and a firearms-related offense.

The remaining two counts are interstate stalking charges, which do not carry the death penalty. Judge Garnett wrote that the dismissed counts 'do not meet the federal statutory definition of a crime of violence as a matter of law.'

Mangione's defense team, led by Karen Agnifilo, has expressed relief at the ruling, with Agnifilo stating, 'We're all very relieved. This incredible decision gives us the space to continue fighting this case.'

The prosecution has 30 days to appeal the ruling. If the appeal is successful, the death penalty could still be an option. However, if the ruling stands, the most severe penalty Mangione could face is life imprisonment.

The case has sparked widespread media attention and public interest, with many following the developments closely.
