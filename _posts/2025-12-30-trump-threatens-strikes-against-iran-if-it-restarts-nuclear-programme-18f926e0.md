**Trump’s stark warning that the United States would “knock the hell out of” Iran if Tehran revived its nuclear programme has set markets on edge, with analysts forecasting a fresh surge in oil prices and a cascade of economic repercussions for Tehran and its chief buyers.** The prospect of a U.S. strike, echoing the June 2025 air raids on Natanz, Fordow and Esfahan, could lift Brent crude by double‑digit percentages, erode Iran’s gross domestic product by up to a dozen per cent, and add a modest but measurable drag on the growth of China, India, South Korea, Japan and the European Union.

The June 2025 strikes already demonstrated how quickly a kinetic response can reverberate through energy markets. Within 48 hours Brent jumped 15‑20 per cent, reaching US$92‑95 a barrel, while WTI settled around US$75‑78. Market models published by JPMorgan indicate that a full closure of the Strait of Hormuz—through which roughly 21 per cent of global petroleum liquids flow—would push Brent up another 5‑7 per cent, potentially breaching the US$100‑a‑barrel threshold. With Iran supplying 3‑4 per cent of world crude, of which only a third is exported, the shock would be amplified by the concentration of its exports: about 90 per cent of Iranian oil flows to China, the remainder to India, South Korea, Japan and the EU.

The direct economic cost to Iran from the June 2025 conflict was estimated at US$24‑35 billion, equivalent to 6.3‑9.2 per cent of its 2025 GDP of roughly US$380 billion. A renewed strike that curtails exports by 30 per cent, combined with a Brent price rise from US$78 to US$90, would shave an additional US$150‑180 billion from annual export revenues—about 4‑5 per cent of GDP. In total, the combined war damage and export loss could contract Iran’s economy by 10‑14 per cent in 2025‑26, deepening the rial’s depreciation and fuelling inflationary pressures.

China, which absorbs almost nine‑tenths of Iranian crude, would feel the impact primarily through higher import bills rather than a loss of supply. A 30 per cent cut in Iranian oil, offset by a 15 per cent rise in global prices, would raise China’s oil‑import cost by US$2 billion, a 0.01 per cent drag on its US$19.5 trillion economy. The broader price increase, however, would add US$8‑10 billion to its overall oil‑import expenditure, amounting to a 0.04‑0.05 per cent GDP hit. For India, South Korea, Japan and the EU—together accounting for US$5 billion of Iranian oil sales—the price shock translates into a 0.01‑0.04 per cent GDP drag, while higher shipping insurance premiums and freight rates could impose an additional 0.1‑0.2 per cent slowdown in these economies.

Beyond the immediate fiscal effects, the threat of heightened geopolitical risk is already inflating insurance premiums for tankers traversing the Gulf, with costs doubling and freight rates climbing 15‑20 per cent. Axios estimates that these risk‑related expenses could add US$3‑5 billion to global trade‑finance costs in the first quarter after a strike, contributing to a 0.1‑0.2 per cent slowdown in worldwide GDP growth for 2025‑26.

Trump’s rhetoric—first voiced at Mar‑a‑Lago on 29 December 2025 and reiterated at Norfolk Naval Station on 5 October 2025—underscores a willingness to translate diplomatic pressure into kinetic action. While the United States’ stated intent is to deter a nuclear resurgence, the economic fallout would be felt far beyond Tehran’s borders, reverberating through oil‑dependent economies and amplifying inflationary pressures worldwide.
