**Japan’s modest year‑on‑year growth masks a quarterly dip, while a weakening yen fuels a record‑high Nikkei and prompts fresh warnings of possible foreign‑exchange intervention.** 

Real GDP in the third quarter of 2025 fell 0.58 % from the previous quarter, slipping to ¥590.14 trillion. Yet the same figure is 0.66 % higher than in Q3 2024, indicating that the economy remains marginally larger than a year ago. The YCharts data, corroborated by the Federal Reserve’s FRED series, confirm the YoY uplift despite the quarter‑on‑quarter contraction. This mixed picture of stagnation and modest expansion underpins the current market dynamics, where currency movements are eclipsing the underlying growth narrative. 

The yen’s slide has become the catalyst for a spectacular equity rally. On 13 January 2026, Fabien Yip of IG reported that the Nikkei 225 surged roughly 3 %—a gain of about 720 points—to breach the 33,500 level, its highest ever. The rally was powered by a yen that drifted toward the 158 JPY/USD mark, inflating the dollar value of export‑oriented earnings. InvestingLive noted that the USD/JPY hovered at 157.96, while the Finance Minister’s verbal “jaw‑boning” produced only a muted reaction in the currency market. 

Analysts, however, caution that the same weakness that lifts the Nikkei could become its Achilles’ heel. MEXC News warned that a sudden yen appreciation—particularly a retreat below the 155 JPY/USD threshold—could erode overseas profit margins and trigger a pull‑back in the index. FXStreet’s Lallalit Srijandorn observed that the yen’s “one‑sided decline” remains a risk to the equity rally, and any sharp reversal would constitute a head‑wind for stocks. The Bank of Japan’s continued negative short‑term rate and modest yield‑curve control stance keep the yen under pressure, sustaining the current equity momentum but leaving the market vulnerable to policy‑driven shifts. 

Tokyo’s response has been measured but unequivocal. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama, speaking in Washington on 12 January 2026, expressed “deep concern” over the yen’s one‑sided depreciation and signalled that “appropriate steps,” including possible foreign‑exchange intervention, remain on the table. A day later in Tokyo she reiterated that “foreign‑exchange intervention remains possible” and that the government is monitoring “sharp, one‑sided moves.” The Japanese government spokesperson echoed this stance, emphasizing readiness to act against “excessive FX volatility.” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed joint concern with Katayama, pledging continued coordination on currency matters. 

Market participants have priced the intervention threshold at roughly ¥158 per dollar, a “soft ceiling” that, if breached, could prompt a ¥2–3 trillion intervention, according to IG’s internal models. The yen’s brief uptick to 157.96 on 13 January proved insufficient to alter the trajectory, and the pair remains near the 158 level, a zone not seen since July 2024 when a ¥3.2 trillion intervention was deployed. 

In sum, Japan’s economy is treading water: a slight YoY gain masks a quarterly contraction, while a depreciating yen fuels a historic equity surge. Analysts view the current environment as a win‑win for the Nikkei but a risk‑on for the yen, with the government poised to intervene should the currency’s decline be deemed “excessive.” The delicate balance between growth, currency policy, and market sentiment will shape Japan’s financial landscape in the weeks ahead.
