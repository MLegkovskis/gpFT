**Chile’s presidential runoff on 14 December 2025 pits right‑wing Republican leader José Antonio Kast against communist Jeannette Jara, with the I‑Poll showing Kast ahead 54 % to 46 % in mid‑October. Markets have already priced in a likely Kast victory: the IPSA index is up 4 % since early October and the peso has appreciated 2 % against the dollar, while Polymarket contracts trade a Kast win at a 30 % premium over Jara. The outcome will determine whether Chile continues its pro‑business trajectory or reverses course toward a “super‑rich” tax and broader state intervention.**

Kast’s campaign promises a dramatic corporate‑tax cut from 27 % to 17 %, a move analysts estimate could add $1.2 bn of after‑tax cash flow to Chilean firms. FintechPulse notes a $6 bn budget reduction in the first 18 months of a Kast administration, while Bloomberg warns that Jara’s pledge to “bury neoliberalism” and introduce new wealth‑tax and environmental levies has already depressed Chile‑focused fund flows by 6 % following her 28 November interview. The divergent fiscal outlook is reflected in investor sentiment: Bloomberg’s Chile‑focused fund‑flow index fell, and the Bloomberg country‑risk premium is projected to rise by roughly 30 basis points under a Jara presidency.

Chilean business groups echo the market split. The Confederación de la Producción (COP) argues that a right‑wing government will preserve certainty for exporters and keep existing free‑trade agreements intact, a view echoed by Banco de Chile’s CEO María López, who says a 17 % corporate‑tax rate would boost profitability and lift loan growth by half a percentage point. Conversely, the Chilean Business Confederation (CCE) warns that a communist president could renegotiate or suspend parts of the Pacific‑Alliance trade pact, potentially raising tariffs on agricultural exports by 2‑3 %. The Federación Nacional de Minería (FENAMIN) stresses that higher taxes would jeopardise mining concessions worth up to $2 bn.

Trade agreements are a key battleground. Under Kast, the Chile‑EU Association Agreement, the Chile‑US Trade Promotion Agreement, and CPTPP commitments are expected to remain unchanged, with Kast even promising deeper market access for mining. Jara’s platform, however, hints at a “re‑balancing” of the EU deal—potentially re‑imposing modest dairy tariffs of around 2 %—and a formal request to renegotiate CPTPP provisions, which could suspend dispute‑settlement mechanisms for six months. Both scenarios would affect the 2025‑26 foreign‑direct investment pipeline, currently estimated at $5.3 bn in mining, agribusiness and finance.

The investment outlook diverges sharply. ThinkInvest projects a 12‑15 % rise in new FDI commitments in 2026 if Kast wins, versus a 5‑7 % contraction under Jara. Bloomberg’s FDI sentiment index is up eight points for a Kast scenario and down six for a Jara outcome. Currency movements reinforce the split: a Kast victory could see the peso strengthen another 2‑3 % against the dollar, while a Jara win might depress it by 4‑5 %. Analysts such as Ian Bezek argue that a pro‑business presidency combined with high commodity prices could deliver annualised GDP growth above 5 %, generating outsized equity returns, especially in copper where output forecasts rise from 5.8 Mt to 6.2 Mt for 2026‑27.

In short, the runoff is more than a political contest; it is a decisive moment for Chile’s macro‑economic policy, trade architecture and attractiveness to foreign capital. International investors are already hedging toward a right‑wing outcome, while domestic business leaders warn that a communist administration could usher in higher taxes, trade‑deal reviews and a higher country‑risk premium, all of which would likely dampen the robust FDI inflows that have underpinned Chile’s recent growth.
