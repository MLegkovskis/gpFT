**The European Union is planning to crack down on 'very dangerous' Chinese parcels, with an estimated annual value of Chinese parcels entering the EU that will be affected by the crackdown standing at approximately €20-30 billion, according to recent reports**. This move is seen as a significant step by the EU to address concerns over the safety and security of imported goods from China. The crackdown is expected to impact a substantial number of Chinese parcels entering the EU, with millions of packages being affected every year.

EU officials have expressed concerns over the lack of proper regulation and oversight of Chinese parcels, which has led to a significant increase in unsafe and counterfeit goods entering the EU. The EU plans to introduce stricter regulations and monitoring mechanisms to ensure that all Chinese parcels comply with EU safety and security standards. This move is expected to have a significant impact on trade relations between the EU and China, with potential repercussions for major logistics companies operating in the region.

According to sources, EU officials have been in talks with Chinese government representatives to discuss the potential impact of the crackdown on trade relations. While the Chinese government has expressed concerns over the move, EU officials have stated that the crackdown is necessary to protect the safety and security of EU citizens. Major logistics companies, such as DHL and UPS, are also expected to be impacted by the crackdown, with potential changes to their operations and protocols for handling Chinese parcels.

The EU's plan to crack down on Chinese parcels is part of a broader effort to strengthen the bloc's trade regulations and protect its citizens from unsafe and counterfeit goods. The move is seen as a significant step towards ensuring that all imported goods, including those from China, comply with EU safety and security standards. As the EU continues to navigate its trade relations with China, the crackdown on Chinese parcels is likely to be a key issue in the months and years to come.
