# US launches strikes on Isis targets in Syria in retaliation for ambush 

**Washington has authorised a fresh wave of air and drone strikes against Islamic State positions in eastern Syria, marking the most intensive use of force since the 2023‑24 train‑and‑assist campaign. The operation is being funded from a suite of defence allocations that together amount to roughly $15‑16 billion annually, a spend that is already tightening the Pentagon’s Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) envelope and adding to a projected $2.89 trillion war‑time bill that will linger in the federal budget for decades.** 

The immediate fiscal outlay for the Syria effort is anchored in the Department of Defence’s FY 2019 allocation of $15.3 billion for Middle‑East operations, supplemented by a further $1 billion in State Department foreign‑aid assistance. A separate $400 million request for FY 2024 targets counter‑ISIS activities specifically in Syria, while the broader Iraq‑Syria “train‑and‑assist” component of Operation Inherent Resolve consumes $1.5 billion – 13 percent of the total $11.9 billion OCO budget for that mission. Together these line items push the OCO portion of the defence budget toward $18 billion in FY 2024, a rise that forces the Pentagon to seek a higher overall defence request – $842 billion for FY 2025, up $12 billion from the previous year. 

The budgetary pressure is two‑fold. First, every additional billion earmarked for OCO directly reduces the discretionary pool available for the DoD’s “Force Development” and “Research, Development, Test & Evaluation” accounts, which together total roughly $90 billion. Analysts warn that sustained OCO growth could crowd out modernisation programmes ranging from hypersonic weapons to cyber‑defence initiatives. Second, the long‑term fiscal liability of the Iraq‑Syria war is dominated by veterans’ care. The Costs of War project estimates that of the $2.89 trillion total, $1.79 trillion has already been spent, while the remaining balance largely reflects future health‑care and disability payments. The Congressional Budget Office projects an extra $300 billion in VA appropriations over the next decade to meet these obligations, extending the budgetary impact well beyond the active combat phase. 

For policymakers, the financial calculus of the latest strikes is inseparable from the political calculus of the Biden administration’s foreign‑policy agenda. The need to sustain a credible deterrent against ISIS, while simultaneously managing a ballooning OCO line, places the administration in a delicate balancing act: any reduction in Syrian funding could be portrayed as a weakening of the U.S. resolve, yet any increase deepens the strain on a defence budget already stretched by competing global priorities in Africa and the Indo‑Pacific. The upward trajectory of OCO spending also fuels bipartisan scrutiny in Congress, where lawmakers are increasingly wary of open‑ended war‑time expenditures that compound the national debt and limit funding for domestic priorities. 

In short, the renewed Syrian strikes are being financed by a complex web of defence and foreign‑aid allocations that together cost $15‑16 billion each year and feed into a cumulative war‑time outlay approaching $3 trillion. The fiscal drag created by these figures is reshaping the Pentagon’s budgetary landscape, compelling tough choices between immediate operational needs and long‑term modernisation and veterans’ obligations.
