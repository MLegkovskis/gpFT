**US technology shares fell sharply on Friday as mounting doubts about the durability of the artificial‑intelligence rally prompted a broad sell‑off, pulling the Nasdaq Composite down 2.5% and extending a weekly loss of more than 5%.**  

## Market Reaction  

The slide was led by the sector’s AI‑heavy names. Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, shed 3.5% of its value, wiping roughly **US$120 billion** off its market capitalisation and taking it to **US$1.8 trillion** – the first sub‑$2 trillion reading since November 2023. Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) also retreated, their shares down 9.8% and 11.6% respectively since 1 December, erasing close to **US$250 billion** in combined market value.  

## Investor Sentiment  

Surveys of institutional investors compiled by Bloomberg on 11 December show that **68%** now view AI‑related equities as “over‑priced”, up from 42% a month earlier. The shift follows a string of earnings misses and guidance cuts from firms that had previously promised “explosive” AI‑driven growth.  

## Key Metrics  

| Index / Stock | 1‑day change | 1‑week change | 1‑month change |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| Nasdaq Composite | **‑2.5%** | **‑5.2%** | **‑9.8%** |
| S&P 500 (tech‑heavy) | **‑1.8%** | **‑4.3%** | **‑7.1%** |
| Dow Jones (tech component) | **‑1.0%** | **‑2.6%** | **‑4.5%** |
| Nvidia (NVDA) | **‑3.5%** | **‑12.4%** | **‑15.3%** |
| Microsoft (MSFT) | **‑2.9%** | **‑9.8%** | **‑10.2%** |
| Alphabet (GOOGL) | **‑3.2%** | **‑11.6%** | **‑12.8%** |

## Analyst Viewpoints  

- **Morgan Stanley** downgraded its “AI‑driven growth” theme to “underweight” on 10 December, citing “inflated revenue multiples that now exceed 70× forward earnings for the sector’s leading players”.  
- **Goldman Sachs** warned that “the current valuation gap between AI‑centric stocks and the broader market is unsustainable without a clear path to margin expansion”.  

## Sector‑wide Impact  

The tech pull‑back reverberated across the broader market. The S&P 500 fell 1.5% on Friday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.0%. Defensive sectors such as utilities and consumer staples outperformed, with the Utilities Select Sector SPDR gaining 0.6% as investors rotated into perceived safety.  

## Outlook  

Looking ahead, market participants will watch upcoming earnings reports from **Meta Platforms (Q4 2024)** and **Amazon (Q4 2024)** for signs that AI investments are translating into profitable revenue streams. Analysts expect volatility to persist until a clearer picture of AI‑related cash‑flow generation emerges, with the consensus forecast for the Nasdaq Composite remaining **‑3% to ‑5%** for the next quarter.  

*The AI boom, once hailed as a new growth engine, now faces a reality check; the coming weeks will determine whether the sector can justify its lofty valuations or succumb to a broader correction.*
