## US Tech Stocks Slide as Fears Over AI Boom Flare Up

**US technology stocks have fallen sharply as investors grow increasingly concerned about the sustainability of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The Nasdaq Composite index, heavily weighted towards tech stocks, dropped by 2.5% on Friday, extending losses for the third consecutive session. This downturn has wiped out $1.1 trillion in market value from the index's peak in July.**

## Market Valuation Concerns

The recent sell‑off has been led by major players in the AI space, including Nvidia, which has lost 11 % of its value since its peak in June. The stock has fallen to $115.15, down from $135.58 on 10 July. Similarly, Microsoft and Alphabet have each declined by around 5 % over the past week. These declines have sparked debate about whether the AI‑driven rally has become overextended.

## Analyst Perspectives

Analysts have pointed out that the valuations of some tech stocks have reached historically high levels. The price‑to‑earnings (P/E) ratio of the Nasdaq Composite has risen to 30.5, significantly above its long‑term average of 24.5. “The market has priced in a lot of optimism around AI, and any sign of weakness could lead to a sharp correction,” said David Leiter, a strategist at Deutsche Bank.

## Sector Rotation and Economic Data

The rotation out of tech stocks comes as investors seek safer assets amid concerns about the US economic outlook. The latest jobs report, which showed a slowdown in hiring, has fuelled recession fears. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10‑year US Treasury bond has fallen to 3.8 %, down from 4.2 % in July. This has made tech stocks, with their high valuations and growth prospects, less attractive to some investors.

## Future Outlook

Despite the short‑term challenges, many analysts remain bullish on the long‑term prospects for the AI sector. “AI is a transformative technology that will continue to drive growth and innovation across industries,” said a report from Goldman Sachs. The bank has maintained its overweight rating on the tech sector, citing the potential for AI to boost productivity and earnings.

## Investor Sentiment

Investor sentiment has turned cautious, with many opting to lock in profits after the significant run‑up in tech stocks. “We’re seeing a bit of a reality check,” said Emily Chen, a portfolio manager at Vanguard. “The AI boom has been incredibly powerful, but it’s not sustainable at this pace.” As investors reassess their positions, the tech sector is likely to experience continued volatility in the coming weeks.
