# Gold Market Sees Record-Breaking Week
The gold market has recorded its best week since 2008, with spot gold breaking $4,800/oz and trading near $5,000/oz by the end of the month. This surge is linked to the Greenland crisis, which has rattled the US dollar and pushed investors into safe-haven assets.
## Revenue Expectations for Gold Mining Companies
Major gold mining companies are anticipating significant revenue growth in 2026, driven by the sustained price rally. The revenue expectations for these companies are as follows:
* Barrick Gold Corp.: $14.8 billion - $15.2 billion
* Newmont Corp.: $12 billion
* AngloGold Ashanti: $7.4 billion - $7.6 billion
* Kinross Gold: $5.1 billion - $5.3 billion
* Gold Fields Ltd.: $5.9 billion - $6.1 billion
## Industry-Wide Market Projections
The global gold mining market is expected to reach $250 billion by the end of 2026, driven by the price surge and expanding production.
