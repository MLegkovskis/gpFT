### Hong Kong’s Jimmy Lai Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison
Jimmy Lai, a prominent Hong Kong media tycoon, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for national security crimes. The sentence, handed down by the High Court in West Kowloon, is the longest ever imposed under Hong Kong’s National Security Law.

Lai was convicted on three counts: two counts of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces and one count of conspiracy to publish seditious material. The convictions stem from allegations that Lai, along with six former Apple Daily executives and two activists, sought foreign sanctions and other hostile actions against Hong Kong and China.

The sentence has been widely condemned by human rights groups and press freedom organizations, who see it as a significant blow to freedom of the press in Hong Kong. Reporters Without Borders described the sentence as a 'cold-blooded attack on freedom of expression', while Amnesty International said it was a 'devastating blow' to human rights in the region.

The sentence is also notable for its length, with Lai set to serve 20 years in prison. Other defendants in the case received shorter sentences, ranging from 6 years and 9 months to 10 years.
