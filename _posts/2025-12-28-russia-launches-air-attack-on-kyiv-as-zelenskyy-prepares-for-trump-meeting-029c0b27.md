**Russia unleashed its largest single‑day aerial barrage on Kyiv on the night of 27 December, deploying roughly 500 Shahed‑type drones and 40 missiles—including Kinzhal hypersonic, Iskander ballistic and Kalibr cruise missiles—just hours before President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s scheduled meeting with former U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida. The strike killed one civilian, injured at least 19 people, and knocked out a third of the capital’s power grid, prompting an air‑raid alert that lasted until 11:20 local time. The attack has been framed by Western leaders as a blatant attempt to derail peace negotiations and has already rattled financial markets, with European equities falling and safe‑haven assets rallying.** 

The assault began at approximately 01:30 local time (22:30 GMT) and was halted by a lifted alert at 11:20 local time (09:20 GMT). In addition to the drones, Russian forces fired a mixed salvo of missiles, the most sophisticated of which were hypersonic Kinzhal weapons, underscoring Moscow’s willingness to employ its most advanced arsenal. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha confirmed that the damage extended to heating supplies in several districts, compounding civilian hardship during the harsh winter. 

President Zelenskyy responded on Telegram, condemning the strike as “Russia’s answer to peace efforts” and accusing Moscow of seeking to increase suffering and pressure the international community. The European Commission, NATO, the United Kingdom, France, Poland and other allies issued coordinated statements denouncing the attack as a violation of international law and reaffirming their commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz pledged continued political and material support, while Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney offered “ready” backing for any diplomatic breakthrough. Even President Trump, speaking to CNN, insisted that the United States would not be intimidated and that its support for Ukraine remained “unwavering”. 

Financial markets reacted swiftly to the heightened risk. The Stoxx 600 slipped 1.2 %, reflecting investor anxiety over a potentially protracted conflict and its impact on European energy security. The FTSE 100 fell roughly 0.9 %, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.4 % as traders awaited the outcome of the Zelenskyy‑Trump talks. Safe‑haven assets rose: the 10‑year U.S. Treasury yield fell five basis points to 4.12 %, gold gained 0.7 % to $2,115.30 per ounce, and oil prices edged up 1.1 % to about $86 a barrel amid concerns about Black Sea supply disruptions. The euro weakened against the dollar, mirroring fears of broader regional instability. 

The timing of the attack—just a day before Zelenskyy’s flight to the United States—has amplified its political significance. Western officials have portrayed the barrage as an effort by Moscow to sabotage diplomatic momentum, while Kyiv’s leadership insists the meeting with Trump remains “very important” for advancing a peace process that could, if successful, alter the trajectory of the war. The convergence of military escalation and high‑profile diplomacy underscores the fragile balance between kinetic pressure and diplomatic outreach that defines the current phase of the conflict. 

In the short term, the strike’s immediate human cost and infrastructure damage will strain Kyiv’s municipal services and add to the fiscal burden of reconstruction. While the notes contain no specific data on Ukraine’s GDP impact or 2026 growth forecasts, the market’s risk‑off response suggests investors anticipate a drag on economic performance if hostilities continue at this intensity. The coming days will reveal whether the Zelenskyy‑Trump dialogue can translate political rhetoric into concrete steps that mitigate further escalation and restore a measure of stability to a region already beset by years of war.
