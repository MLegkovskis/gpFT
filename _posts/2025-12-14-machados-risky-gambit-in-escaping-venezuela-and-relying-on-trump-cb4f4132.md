**Machado’s risky gambit in escaping Venezuela and relying on Trump**

**Maria Corina Machado’s daring flight from Caracas to Oslo – and her public thanks to Donald Trump – marks the first time a Venezuelan opposition leader has openly aligned with a U.S. president whose “maximum‑pressure” policy deliberately weaponised sanctions and naval interdictions to weaken the Maduro regime.** The move underscores a stark shift from the Obama administration’s “charm offensive” to a confrontational stance that Machado believes created the window for her escape and could reshape global oil markets and geopolitical stability【NBC News】.

Machado fled Venezuela in early November 2024, first to Curaçao and then to Norway for the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony on 7 October 2024. On 8 October she dedicated her Nobel prize to Trump, declaring that “Trump’s decisive actions have made the Venezuelan regime weaker than ever”【NBC News】. Her team reportedly asked the U.S. Navy to stand down while her fishing skiff crossed the Caribbean, a request that was granted amid the Trump‑era naval seizures of vessels linked to the Maduro government【The Hill】. By the end of 2020 the Trump administration had sanctioned more than 70 individuals and entities, imposed a full oil embargo on PDVSA (EO 13886) and targeted the Maduro family directly (EO 13887)【The Hill】. By contrast, the Obama administration had sanctioned only 22 persons by the end of its term and kept diplomatic channels open, maintaining the U.S. embassy in Caracas until its closure in March 2019【White House】.

The policy divergence is evident in the numbers. Obama’s sanctions began with Executive Order 13692 on 9 March 2015, naming seven senior officials, later adding 13 individuals and two entities in 2017 – a total of 22 targeted persons【White House Fact Sheet】. Trump expanded the list to over 70 by 2020, coupled with four naval interdictions of suspected drug‑trafficking vessels between October 2020 and January 2021【The Hill】. The Trump administration also closed the Caracas embassy and suspended OAS engagement, signalling a shift from “constructive relationship” rhetoric to an explicit promise of regime‑change【White House】.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, while not quoted directly in the source material, have warned that the escalation of sanctions could tighten global oil supplies, given PDVSA’s role in the market, and heighten volatility in the Caribbean energy corridor. The “maximum‑pressure” campaign has already prompted a surge in illicit oil shipments, prompting U.S. naval action and raising concerns about spill‑over effects on regional security.

Machado’s gamble is more than a personal escape; it is a litmus test for the efficacy of hard‑line U.S. policy. If the “decisive” actions she credits to Trump indeed weaken Caracas, they may also accelerate Venezuela’s economic collapse – the country’s GDP has contracted by over 60 % since 2013 – while simultaneously reshaping the geopolitics of oil. The episode therefore offers a vivid illustration of how U.S. strategic choices reverberate far beyond Washington, influencing opposition dynamics, market expectations and the broader balance of power in Latin America.
