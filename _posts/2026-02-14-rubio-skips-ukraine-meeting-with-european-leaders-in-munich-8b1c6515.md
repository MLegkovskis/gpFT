# Rubio Skips Ukraine Meeting with European Leaders in Munich
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio skipped a high-profile meeting with European leaders to discuss Ukraine, sparking negative reactions from European officials. The meeting, held on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, was attended by leaders from around a dozen European countries, as well as the European Commission, European Council, and NATO.
## Implications for Rubio's Relationships with European Leaders
Rubio's last-minute cancellation generated negative reactions, with one European official calling it 'insane' and another saying the meeting 'lacked substance' without US participation. This may erode Rubio's personal rapport with European leaders and reduce US influence on EU-US Ukraine strategy.
## Implications for US-Europe Cooperation on Ukraine
The US Secretary of State's absence may weaken coordinated messaging and bargaining power, potentially emboldening Russian diplomatic maneuvers. However, Rubio's separate bilateral talks with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and his public statement reaffirming US support for Ukraine may have mitigated some of the damage.
