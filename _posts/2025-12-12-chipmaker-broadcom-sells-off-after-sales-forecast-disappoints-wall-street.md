**Broadcom’s shares fell sharply after the chipmaker issued a second‑quarter sales forecast that missed Wall Street expectations, underscoring growing pressure in the semiconductor sector.** The company projected revenue of **$10.5 billion** for the quarter ending 30 June, versus the **$11.1 billion** consensus of analysts surveyed by Reuters. The miss triggered an immediate **≈7 % decline** in Broadcom’s stock in after‑hours trading, taking the share price to its lowest level since early 2023.

## Forecast Shortfall and Immediate Market Reaction  
Broadcom’s guidance was released at 08:30 GMT on 30 April 2024. The forecast shortfall reflects weaker demand in its semiconductor solutions division, particularly for data‑centre and networking components that have been hit by a broader industry slowdown. The sell‑off widened the company’s year‑to‑date loss to roughly **10 %**, lagging the S&P 500 Semiconductor Index, which has risen about **12 %** over the same period.

## Recent Financial Performance  
In the first quarter, Broadcom reported **$9.29 billion** in revenue, a **5 % increase** on a year‑earlier basis, driven largely by its semiconductor solutions segment, which contributed **$6.82 billion**. Infrastructure software revenue rose to **$2.47 billion**. However, net income fell to **$1.32 billion** (earnings per share **$2.42**) from **$1.69 billion** (EPS **$3.09**) a year earlier, reflecting higher operating costs and a modest rise in tax expense.

## Industry Context  
The semiconductor market has been contracting since the second half of 2023, with global shipments down **2 %** year‑on‑year in Q1 2024, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Supply‑chain bottlenecks have eased, but demand for high‑performance chips remains volatile amid cautious corporate capital‑expenditure plans and lingering macro‑economic uncertainty.

## Management Outlook  
Chief Executive Hock Tan attributed the forecast gap to “a temporary dip in demand for certain networking products and the impact of a softer macro environment.” The company reaffirmed its long‑term target of **$30 billion** in annual revenue and signalled continued investment in its **infrastructure‑software** platform, which it expects to deliver higher‑margin growth.

## Investor Focus  
Analysts will be watching Broadcom’s execution of its diversification strategy, particularly the rollout of its **Broadcom Software** suite and progress on the **VMware** integration, which is slated for completion in 2025. The firm’s ability to stabilise semiconductor‑segment margins while expanding software‑as‑a‑service revenue will be pivotal for restoring investor confidence.
