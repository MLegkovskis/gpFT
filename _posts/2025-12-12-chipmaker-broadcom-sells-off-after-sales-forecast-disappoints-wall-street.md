**Broadcom’s shares slid more than 6 % after the chipmaker warned that fiscal‑2025 revenue will fall short of Wall Street forecasts, underscoring a slowdown in demand for its flagship networking and wireless‑infrastructure products.** The company projected revenue of **$44.5 billion** for the year to 30 November, versus the **$45.5 billion** consensus estimate compiled by Refinitiv, prompting a sharp sell‑off in after‑hours trading on 21 February 2025.  

## Forecast Miss and Guidance  
Broadcom’s management said the lower outlook reflects “continued softness in the data‑centre and wireless‑infrastructure markets” and a “more cautious spending environment among key enterprise customers”. The guidance of $44.5 bn represents a **2.2 % decline** from the $45.5 bn consensus and a **3 % dip** from the company’s own prior outlook of $45.9 bn announced in November 2024.  

## Quarterly Performance (Q4 FY 2024)  
- **Revenue:** $13.5 bn, up **5 %** year‑on‑year, driven by a rebound in the semiconductor solutions segment.  
- **Net income:** $5.5 bn, or **$6.00 per share**, compared with $5.2 bn, or $5.70 per share, a **6 % earnings increase**.  
- **Operating margin:** 41 %, marginally above the 40 % recorded in Q4 2023.  

While the quarter beat internal targets, the forward‑looking guidance eclipsed the positive results, prompting investors to reassess growth expectations.  

## Market Reaction  
Broadcom’s stock opened at **$620** on the Nasdaq, fell **6.3 %** to **$581** by the close of after‑hours trading, and its market capitalisation slipped to roughly **$210 bn**. Analysts at JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley trimmed their price targets by an average of **5 %**, citing “heightened competitive pressure from rivals such as Marvell and Qualcomm, and a lingering inventory correction in the data‑centre segment”.  

## Industry Context  
The broader semiconductor sector has been grappling with a **3‑4 % contraction** in global wafer shipments over the past two quarters, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). Demand for 5G‑related chips remains robust, yet enterprise‑grade networking equipment orders have softened as firms defer capital‑expenditure projects amid uncertain macro‑economic conditions.  

## Outlook and Strategic Moves  
Broadcom’s CEO, Hock Tan, reaffirmed the company’s commitment to “organic growth and strategic acquisitions”, highlighting the pending integration of the recently announced **VMware** acquisition, expected to close in Q3 2025. The firm will host a conference call at 09:30 GMT on 22 February to elaborate on its cost‑control programme and the timeline for the VMware deal.  

Analysts will be watching for any revision to the **$44.5 bn** revenue target, particularly whether the company can offset the slowdown with higher‑margin software‑defined networking (SDN) offerings and the anticipated upside from the VMware integration.
