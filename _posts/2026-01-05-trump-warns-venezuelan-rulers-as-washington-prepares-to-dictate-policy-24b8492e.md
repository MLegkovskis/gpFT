# Trump warns Venezuelan rulers as Washington prepares to dictate policy 

**President Donald Trump announced on 3 January 2026 from Mar‑a‑Lago that the United States would “run” Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” could be achieved, promising to “fix” the oil sector and make it “make a lot of money.”** He framed the move as a bid for “peace, liberty and justice” for the Venezuelan people and said a U.S.–led group, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would work with Venezuelan officials. The declaration set off a rapid cascade of political condemnation, partisan debate and market repositioning.

Venezuelan authorities responded with uniform outrage. Acting interim president and Vice‑President Delcy Rodríguez, speaking on state television on 4 January, denounced the plan as “a brutal aggression against the Venezuelan people” and demanded the immediate release of President Nicolás Maduro. In a televised interview the following day she softened the tone, urging “peace and dialogue, not war,” yet she continued to reject any U.S. authority over the country. Maduro himself, speaking from a secure location on 4 January, called the United States “imperial aggression” and warned that “any attempt to ‘run’ our country will be met with resistance.” Both leaders framed the announcement as an illegal breach of sovereignty and a direct threat to the nation’s stability.

Opposition leader María Corina Machado, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, countered Trump’s narrative by accusing Washington of a covert resource grab. At a press conference on 4 January she asserted that the true objective of U.S. aggression was “regime change and the capture of our energy, mineral and natural resources.” She bolstered her claim with a 15 March 2025 ClearPath Strategies poll showing 72 % approval among Venezuelans, underscoring her popular legitimacy and challenging Trump’s suggestion that she lacked respect.

In Washington the reaction split sharply along party lines. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking at the 3 January press conference, announced a “military quarantine on certain Venezuelan oil exports” until the interim government complied with U.S. transparency and anti‑drug demands. He later praised Trump’s plan as a “bold step” that demonstrated America’s resolve. Republican Senator Ted Cruz echoed this sentiment on 5 January, warning that if Washington could dictate policy in Caracas it must be ready to do the same wherever U.S. security is threatened. By contrast, Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio‑Cortez tweeted on 5 January that the United States “has no right to ‘run’ a sovereign nation” and warned of a dangerous precedent for imperialism.

Financial markets reacted swiftly to the prospect of unlocking Venezuela’s dormant oil reserves. Brent crude closed on 4 January up 2.3 % at $92.15 per barrel, with WTI matching the rise at $88.70. U.S. oil majors saw their shares climb—Exxon Mobil +1.8 % and Chevron +2.1 %—as investors priced in potential new contracts. The Venezuelan bolívar depreciated 4.5 % against the dollar, reflecting heightened political risk. Goldman Sachs analysts estimated that 300 million barrels of idle oil could be released, generating $5‑$7 billion in revenue for U.S. firms. Hedge funds quickly moved: Bridgewater Associates added $200 million and Renaissance Technologies $150 million to Venezuelan‑oil‑futures exposure during the week of 4‑5 January. Oil‑service firms signalled readiness to capitalise on the opening; Glencore announced plans to sign $1.2 billion of contracts within six months for refinery refurbishment, while Vitol pledged logistical support for a rapid restart of Venezuelan refineries.

The combined political and market response illustrates how Trump’s warning has ignited a multi‑front contest over Venezuela’s oil wealth. Caracas’ leadership frames the United States’ move as illegal imperialism, the opposition portrays it as a resource‑driven power play, and Washington’s own establishment is divided between hawkish endorsement and democratic rebuke. Meanwhile, commodity traders and oil majors have already begun to price in a future where U.S. influence could reshape the flow of Venezuelan crude, a development that could reverberate across global energy markets for months to come.
