### Swedish PM Sceptical of French 'Buy European' Push
The Swedish Prime Minister, Ulf Kristersson, has expressed scepticism towards the French-led 'Buy European' initiative. This stance reflects Sweden's historic policy of maximising market access while limiting political surrender. Kristersson's comment signals a pre-emptive rejection of protectionism and re-affirms Sweden's preference for open competition.

### Institutional Coordination and Public Opinion
Sweden's reaction is part of a coordinated Nordic-Baltic front against protectionist EU policies. A joint non-paper submitted to the European Commission in December 2025 demonstrates institutional coordination among Sweden and other member states. Public opinion in Sweden also supports EU membership but is wary of further sovereignty surrender, mirroring the government's line on open markets and limited integration.

### Political Consensus and Previous Positions
The Swedish government's stance is consistent with its previous positions on EU integration. All major parties except the far-right Sweden Democrats support staying in the EU, and the government coalition values economic integration while guarding national regulatory autonomy. Sweden has previously co-authored EU-wide initiatives emphasizing harmonisation over protectionism, such as the 'digital-single-market' and 'green-transition' initiatives.

### Bottom Line
The Swedish PM's scepticism is not an isolated reaction but mirrors a consistent government posture favouring open, rules-based European cooperation and resisting new protectionist layers.
