**EU plans crackdown on ‘very dangerous’ Chinese parcels**  

The European Union will impose a €3 flat duty on every low‑value e‑commerce parcel ≤ €150 arriving from China, ending the long‑standing “de‑minimis” exemption early and targeting an estimated €1 billion‑a‑year flow of “very dangerous” shipments that evade duties, pose safety risks and generate environmental damage【Reuters】(https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-aims-raise-1bn-annual-levy-very-dangerous-chinese-parcels-2025-12-12/).  

The measure, agreed by finance ministers on 13 Nov 2025 and confirmed by the Council on 12 Dec 2025, will take effect on 1 Jul 2026 as a temporary €3 per‑item levy, with a permanent removal of the €150 exemption slated for 2028【Reuters】(https://www.reuters.com/world/china/eu-impose-3-euro-duty-small-e-commerce-parcels-july-2026-2025-12-12/).  The EU estimates that 4.6 billion parcels entered the bloc in 2024 – roughly 12 million each day – and that more than 90 % of these low‑value shipments originate from China, of which about 65 % are deliberately undervalued to avoid customs duties【Yahoo Finance】(https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-eu-plans-crack-down-142239117.html).  

Unlike the sector‑specific anti‑dumping and anti‑subsidy duties introduced during the 2020 trade‑defence wave – which targeted Chinese solar panels (up to 47 % duty) and washing machines (up to 38 % duty)【Reuters】(https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-china-trade-tariffs-idUSKBN23Y1AP) – the 2025‑2026 crackdown is breadth‑first. It amends the EU Customs Code’s “de‑minimis” exemption, obliging a mandatory customs declaration for every parcel ≤ €150 and collecting the €3 levy at entry【Reuters】. The policy is framed as part of a “green‑trade‑fairness” agenda, linking consumer safety, climate impact of short‑life goods and market‑leveling, rather than a pure anti‑subsidy response【Reuters】.  

The financial impact is modest per parcel but massive in aggregate. A €3 charge on 4.6 billion parcels would generate roughly €1 billion annually, the figure quoted by the EU Council as the expected additional customs revenue【Reuters】. By contrast, the 2020 duties affected about €5 billion of Chinese imports in the targeted sectors, but only a narrow range of products. The new levy therefore represents a shift from “depth” (high tariffs on specific goods) to “breadth” (low‑level charges on a vast volume of everyday items).  

For Chinese e‑commerce platforms such as Shein, Temu, AliExpress and Amazon Haul, the cost will either be absorbed, squeezing margins, or passed on to consumers, potentially dampening the price advantage that has driven the surge in low‑value parcels. EU retailers will welcome a level playing field, as the duty eliminates the “unfair competition” created by undervalued imports that currently flood the market【Reuters】.  

Both the 2020 anti‑subsidy regime and the 2025‑2026 parcel levy share the strategic aim of protecting European industry, yet they differ sharply in scope, legal mechanism and the mix of economic, safety and environmental objectives. The parcel crackdown signals a hardening EU stance that blends digital customs enforcement with value‑based taxation, foreshadowing a more systematic approach to Chinese trade flows beyond the sector‑specific tools of the past.
