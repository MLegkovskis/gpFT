**EU moves to curb “very dangerous” Chinese parcels, targeting €10 billion of low‑value shipments annually** – The European Commission has announced a sweeping reform that will end the €150 de‑minimis exemption for parcels from non‑EU countries, introduce a €3 customs fee and a digital import system to verify true values. The measures aim to halt a flood of under‑priced Chinese parcels that, in 2024, amounted to 4.6 billion shipments – more than 90 % of all low‑value parcels entering the bloc – and are estimated to be worth about €10 billion each year.

The crackdown follows a policy timeline that began on 30 September 2024, when the Commission first flagged the “very dangerous” nature of the trade. By 12 December 2025 EU finance ministers had agreed to the €3 temporary customs charge, slated to take effect from July 2026. The new digital import platform, slated for full operation by 2028, will allow customs authorities to cross‑check declared values and collect the correct VAT and duties, addressing the Commission’s estimate that roughly 65 % of these parcels are deliberately undervalued.

EU officials have framed the move as a defence of the internal market. Trade Commissioner Vít Šefčovič told the Council of the EU on 13 November 2025 that the Union would be ready to implement the rules as early as 2026 to protect European businesses and ensure a level playing field. Italian Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti echoed the sentiment, describing the tax as a necessary response to a phenomenon “destroying retail trade”. Internal Market Commissioner Margaritis Schinas added that the digital system would make it possible to verify every parcel’s true value.

Chinese authorities have warned that the steps could spark further trade friction. Spokesperson Zhang Zhengguo of the Foreign Ministry, speaking on 13 December 2025, urged the EU to respect market openness and avoid protectionist measures, while Commerce Minister Wang Wentao warned that unilateral action could disrupt cross‑border e‑commerce and harm Chinese enterprises.

Logistics firms anticipate the fee will be passed on to consumers. DHL Express warned on 12 December 2025 that the €3 duty could raise shipping costs by up to €5 per parcel and lengthen delivery times. UPS foresees a €2‑€3 increase to each parcel under €150, and FedEx pledged to optimise routes to keep the impact modest.

E‑commerce platforms, whose business models rely on ultra‑low prices, have responded with a mix of caution and concession. Shein’s EU head told Bloomberg on 13 December 2025 that the duty would inevitably raise prices but the company would absorb part of the cost. Temu, quoted by the Financial Times, said the €3 charge would appear at checkout rather than on product listings, preserving price transparency. Alibaba’s AliExpress signalled a strategic review on 14 December 2025, pledging to work with logistics partners to minimise consumer costs. Retail association EuroCommerce welcomed the removal of the exemption, calling it a long‑overdue step to stop unfair competition.

The crackdown marks the most comprehensive attempt by the EU to rein in the surge of cheap Chinese parcels that have reshaped the continent’s retail landscape. With the digital import system and customs fee set to roll out next year, the balance between open e‑commerce and fair competition will be tested in the months ahead.
