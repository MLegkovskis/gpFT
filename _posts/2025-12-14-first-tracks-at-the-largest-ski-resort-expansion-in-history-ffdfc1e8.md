**First tracks at the ‘largest ski‑resort expansion in history’** – Deer Valley Resort in Utah has opened the initial phase of a $400 million development that will more than double its skiable terrain. The project is projected to inject roughly $1.2 billion into Wasatch County’s gross domestic product over the next decade and to create about 2,000 new jobs across construction, operations and hospitality. 

The first lifts and runs, part of a phased rollout that began in winter 2024/25, give skiers access to over 300 acres of previously untouched slopes and three new lifts, including a modern gondola. By the 2025/26 season the resort will have added 2,000 acres and ten lifts, delivering roughly 100 new runs. The full build‑out, slated for completion by the 2027/28 winter season, will see a total of 5,726 acres of skiable terrain and 16 new lifts, raising the lift count to 37 and cementing Deer Valley’s claim as the world’s biggest ski‑resort expansion. 

Economic forecasts released in an April 15 2024 press statement underscore the scale of the investment. The $400 million outlay is expected to generate $1.3 billion in annual economic activity for the wider Wasatch region, a figure that reflects not only the direct spending on construction and resort operations but also the multiplier effect on local businesses such as hotels, restaurants and retail outlets. Over ten years, the cumulative boost to the county’s GDP is estimated at $1.2 billion, equivalent to an average of $120 million per year. 

Job creation is a central pillar of the development’s promise. The Deer Valley “Expanded Terrain” project page, accessed on 14 December 2025, lists a projected 2,000 additional positions, spanning full‑time, part‑time and seasonal roles. These include construction crews, lift operators, ski‑school instructors, hospitality staff and ancillary service providers. The influx of employment is expected to alleviate the seasonal volatility that has traditionally characterised the region’s labour market. 

The expansion’s timeline reflects a methodical approach. An August 2023 partnership announcement set the groundwork for the $400 million investment. The first phase, delivering 300 plus acres and three lifts, opened in winter 2024/25, accompanied by 500 new parking spaces to accommodate the anticipated rise in visitor numbers. The subsequent winter 2025/26 phase will see the bulk of the terrain added, while the final stage, projected for 2027/28, will complete the transformation into a resort of unprecedented size. 

Beyond the headline figures, the development signals a strategic shift for Deer Valley and its parent company, Alterra Mountain Company. By expanding the skiable footprint dramatically, the resort aims to capture a larger share of the growing global ski tourism market, particularly as climate change pressures lower‑elevation ski areas. The added gondola and modern lift infrastructure also enhance the resort’s capacity to manage higher visitor volumes while maintaining the premium experience that has defined Deer Valley’s brand. 

While the economic upside is clear, the scale of the project inevitably raises questions about environmental stewardship and community impact. The expansion will traverse previously undeveloped mountain terrain, prompting scrutiny from conservation groups and local residents. However, the publicly available project documentation emphasizes sustainable construction practices and a commitment to preserving the natural character of the Wasatch range. 

In sum, Deer Valley’s ambitious expansion stands as a landmark moment for the North American ski industry. Its projected $1.2 billion contribution to local GDP, the creation of 2,000 jobs and the sheer magnitude of new terrain position the resort at the forefront of post‑pandemic tourism recovery and long‑term regional development.
