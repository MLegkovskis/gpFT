**Deer Valley’s $500 million “Expanded Excellence” project is set to open its first new runs on 1 December 2025, marking the debut of the largest single‑resort terrain expansion in ski‑history and promising a $1.2 billion boost to Summit County’s economy and roughly 2,000 new jobs.**【Deseret (May 10 2024)】【Powder (Mar 12 2025)】

The Utah‑based resort will more than double its skiable area, adding 3,700 acres to bring the total to about 4,300 acres – an increase of over 100 % – together with 10 new lifts, including a 10‑person gondola, and more than 80 new runs. Construction began in summer 2024, with lift towers slated for installation in summer 2025 and the first‑track season scheduled for 2025‑26【Deseret (May 10 2024)】. The public‑private partnership behind the venture involves Alterra Mountain Company, Extell Development and the Military Installation Development Authority, and carries a total capital outlay of $500 million【Deseret (May 10 2024)】.

**Economic and employment impact**  
The expansion is projected to generate $1.2 billion in cumulative economic activity over the next decade – roughly a 3‑4 % uplift to the county’s annual GDP – and to create about 2,000 permanent and construction‑phase positions across operations, hospitality, retail and ancillary services【Deseret (May 10 2024)】【Powder (Mar 12 2025)】. Local officials echo these figures: Mayor Monica Zhang of Park City anticipates an extra $250 million in annual tourism spend and roughly 1,500 construction jobs in the first two years【Salt Lake Tribune】, while Governor Spencer Cox stresses that the new jobs will be filled by Utah workers【Deseret News】.

**Industry perspective**  
Todd Bennett, President & COO of Deer Valley, hailed the lift‑tower milestone as “the start of skiing from Park Peak” and a “key step in more than doubling Deer Valley’s terrain”【Deer Valley press release】. CEO Mike Foley of Alterra framed the project as the “flagship of our $400 million investment in the Wasatch,” emphasizing its role as an “economic engine” that will also preserve the resort’s “ski‑only, low‑capacity model”【PR‑wire】. Marketing Vice‑President Susie English added that the expanded map “reflects how far we’ve come in realizing our vision to elevate the Deer Valley experience while still maintaining the character and care that define our resort”【Deer Valley press release】.

**Political and environmental considerations**  
State Senator Ellen Miller announced $12 million in infrastructure grants to improve public‑transport links, a move aimed at mitigating traffic on I‑80 and Park Peak Road【KSL TV】. Rep. David Kline warned that “any expansion of a ski‑only resort must balance growth with stewardship,” pledging strict oversight of water‑right applications and watershed protection【Deseret News】. Governor Cox reiterated the state’s commitment to rigorous environmental standards and local hiring【Deseret News】. Foley acknowledged the challenges, citing water use for snow‑making, traffic congestion and wildlife corridors, and outlined mitigation measures such as a 10‑million‑gallon snow‑making reservoir, upgraded storm‑water treatment and habitat‑restoration corridors【PR‑wire】.

**Bottom line**  
Deer Valley’s “Expanded Excellence” expansion will reshape the Wasatch ski market, delivering a dramatic increase in terrain, a substantial economic stimulus and a sizeable job market, while navigating water, traffic and ecological concerns through coordinated public‑private action.
