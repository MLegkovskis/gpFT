**Hamas accuses Israel of sabotaging ceasefire after commander is targeted, mirroring a historical pattern of violence and broken truces**. The latest incident, in which Israel targeted and killed senior Hamas commander "Abu Al-Quds" in a drone strike on the outskirts of Gaza, has sparked accusations from Hamas that Israel is sabotaging the fragile ceasefire. This is not an isolated event, but rather part of a well-documented cycle of violence and broken truces that has persisted for nearly two decades.

The historical pattern of ceasefire agreements and violations between Hamas and Israel is marked by a trigger-and-retaliation cycle, where every ceasefire since 2008 has been broken first by a targeted killing of a senior Hamas commander. This has been followed by Hamas accusations of ceasefire sabotage, rocket fire in retaliation, and a broader Israeli response. The Oct 30 2024 event follows exactly this script, with Hamas immediately launching a salvo of Qassam rockets and Israel responding with artillery fire.

According to [Palestine Nexus](https://palestinenexus.com/articles/a-history-of-ceasefire-talks-between-israel-and-hamas), there have been **10-12 major ceasefire agreements** since 2005, with most lasting **3-6 months** before collapsing. The average length of post-2008 ceasefires is approximately **4-5 months** before a major breach. [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/how-many-times-has-israel-violated-the-gaza-ceasefire-here-are-the-numbers) reports that there have been **738 separate incidents of Israeli violations** since October 2025, including airstrikes, artillery, raids, demolitions, and detentions.

The pattern of Israeli targeted killings of senior Hamas commanders is a strategic objective to force Hamas back to the negotiating table, while Hamas frames each killing as a breach of the ceasefire to rally domestic and international support. As [Open Democracy](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/north-africa-west-asia/ceasefires-in-which-violations-never-cease-whats-next-for-israel-hamas-) notes, "Hamas, by and large, observes the agreement. Israel, by and large, does not."

The economic cost of the renewed conflict to the Gaza Strip's GDP, which was already at $3.4bn in 2022, is estimated to be significant. However, exact figures are not available due to the lack of recent data.

In conclusion, the latest incident is not an outlier, but rather a repeat of a well-documented pattern where Israel's "sabotage" (the killing) triggers Hamas's claim of breach, followed by renewed rocket fire and a broader escalation. As [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-accuses-israel-sabotaging-ceasefire-after-commander-targeted-2024-10-30/) reports, Hamas has stated that "Israel's assassination of Abu Al-Quds is a blatant sabotage of the ceasefire we have been trying to keep."
