**France has warned that any U.S. attempt to seize Greenland would jeopardise the trans‑Atlantic trade relationship that underpins roughly $1.5 trillion of annual commerce, a shock that could wipe out 5‑6 % of American GDP and up to 10 % of the European Union’s output.** The French government’s alarm follows a series of statements from President Emmanuel Macron, Finance Minister Roland Lescure and other senior officials, all of which stress that the sovereignty of Denmark – and by extension that of the EU – cannot be compromised without “unprecedented” repercussions for the EU‑U.S. partnership.

The economic stakes are stark. In 2024, U.S. goods and services trade with the EU amounted to an estimated $1.5 trillion, representing about 5.6 % of U.S. GDP and 9.5 % of EU GDP. The two economies together account for almost 30 % of global trade in goods and services and 43 % of world GDP. If a Greenland seizure were to disrupt the full flow of this trade, the exposure would be measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars, a loss comparable to a major recessionary shock for both sides.

French officials have framed the issue in both strategic and economic terms. On 8 January, President Macron told French ambassadors that “if the sovereignty of a European ally were affected, the cascading consequences would be unprecedented,” signalling that any breach of Denmark’s authority over Greenland would trigger a chain reaction across diplomatic and commercial channels. The following day, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sought to calm the situation, affirming that Washington “respect[s] the sovereignty of our allies and will not pursue any unilateral action that would undermine our trans‑Atlantic partnership,” and emphasizing cooperation on climate, security and Arctic research rather than territorial acquisition.

Finance Minister Lescure, speaking to the *Financial Times* on 16 January, warned that a Greenland seizure would be “a crossed line” that would endanger Europe’s economic relationship with Washington. He directly addressed U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, underscoring that “Greenland is a sovereign part of a sovereign country that is part of the EU. That shouldn’t be messed around with.” The same day, Foreign Minister Jean‑Noël Barrot dismissed any notion of a U.S. military intervention as “blackmailing” Denmark, while Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu cautioned that President Donald Trump’s rhetoric about the island’s strategic value must be taken “very seriously.”

Trump’s earlier remarks that control of Greenland is “vital” for U.S. security – tied to a proposed “Golden Dome” air‑and‑missile‑defence system – have reignited a long‑standing tension over Arctic resources and strategic positioning. For the EU, the issue is not merely about a remote island but about the legal order that protects the sovereignty of its members. French officials have repeatedly pledged “full solidarity with Denmark,” suggesting that any unilateral move by Washington could provoke coordinated diplomatic or economic retaliation from the bloc.

The potential fallout extends beyond immediate trade figures. The EU‑U.S. Trade and Technology Council, currently negotiating new standards on digital trade and green technology, could see its agenda stalled, while the broader trans‑Atlantic security architecture – already strained by divergent approaches to climate policy and defence spending – might be further eroded. In a climate of heightened geopolitical competition in the Arctic, the French warning serves as a reminder that economic interdependence and respect for sovereign rights remain the twin pillars of the partnership.

If the United States were to ignore these cautions, the resulting disruption could reverberate through supply chains, financial markets and strategic dialogues, reshaping the balance of power in the North Atlantic. For now, the diplomatic dance continues, with Paris urging Washington to keep its ambitions in the Arctic firmly within the bounds of multilateral cooperation.
