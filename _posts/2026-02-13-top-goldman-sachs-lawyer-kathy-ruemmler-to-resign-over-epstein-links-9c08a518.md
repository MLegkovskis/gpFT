### Kathy Ruemmler's Resignation and Its Impact on Goldman Sachs
Kathy Ruemmler, Goldman Sachs' top lawyer, has resigned due to her links with Jeffrey Epstein. The announcement led to a short-term stock price drop of -4.24% on February 12, 2026. However, the stock price recovered modestly, with a 0.6% gain the next day, and a 1.59% gain over a 5-day window.

The resignation is viewed as a contained, non-fundamental event, with the market pricing in the reputational shock quickly. The 120-day window shows a strong up-trend, with a 26.3% overall gain, indicating that the resignation does not materially alter long-term fundamentals.

### Regulatory Scrutiny and Potential Impact
The resignation could lead to a broader regulatory scrutiny of Goldman Sachs, with potential implications for the company's revenue and the broader banking sector. The estimated direct impact on US GDP is approximately 0.0012%, while the indirect/sector-wide impact could reach 0.08% of US GDP.
