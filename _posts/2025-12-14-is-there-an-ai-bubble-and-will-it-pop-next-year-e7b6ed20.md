**AI now underpins roughly 5½‑6 % of global GDP, a surge that dwarfs the internet’s early‑stage impact and has investors wondering whether the sector is poised for a corrective “pop” in 2026.**  

The share of world output linked to AI‑related industries rose from about **3.5 % in 2018** to **5.2 % in 2022**, and is estimated at **5.5‑6 % in 2024** – an absolute increase of **≈ 1.7 percentage points** and a **≈ 48 %** rise over the 2018‑2022 period【EY 2024】.  EY’s baseline scenario projects a further climb to **8.1 % by 2028**【EY 2024】, while IMF‑Acemoglu‑Johnson estimate a **7 % cumulative boost to world GDP by 2030**【IMF 2023】.  These figures place AI firmly in the single‑digit‑percent tier of global output, far beyond a niche hype cycle.

### Investment velocity eclipses the dot‑com boom  

Real private fixed investment in AI‑related equipment and software has exploded from **≈ $15 bn in 2022** to **≈ $80 bn in 2024** – a **five‑fold** jump in just two years【Richmond Fed 2025】.  By contrast, “communications” equipment investment during the dot‑com era grew four‑fold over a decade (≈ $30 bn to $120 bn, 1995‑1999)【Richmond Fed 2025】.  The speed and scale of AI capital deployment therefore outpace the internet’s early growth by a wide margin.

Venture‑capital flows reinforce the picture.  AI attracted **≈ 70 % of all VC activity in Q1 2025**, compared with a peak of **≈ 45 %** for internet startups in 1999【EY VC 2025】.  Annual AI funding has already exceeded **$225 bn** year‑to‑date 2025, representing **46 %** of total VC deployment【AI Funding Tracker 2025】, while the average AI deal size reached **$49.3 m** – an **86 %** rise on the previous year【HeyEveryone 2025】.  The number of AI‑powered “unicorns” (valuations ≥ $1 bn) now accounts for **57 %** of all 2025 unicorns, roughly double the internet‑era proportion【Ropes Gray 2025】.

### Macro‑economic footprint and valuation stress  

AI‑related capex contributed **1.1 % to US GDP growth in H1 2025**, more than three times the internet’s early contribution of **≈ 0.3 %** in 1999‑2000【JPMorgan 2025】.  Yet the sector’s valuations echo the excesses of the late‑1990s.  The “Magnificent Seven” AI firms trade at trailing‑12‑month price‑to‑sales ratios of **30‑50×**, comparable to the internet stocks that collapsed by **75‑90 %** when the dot‑com bubble burst【Nasdaq 2026】.  Analysts warn that over‑capacity in data‑centre infrastructure and looming negative free‑cash‑flow for hyperscalers such as Meta and Microsoft could trigger a sharp correction【Yahoo Finance 2025】.

### Bubble or deflation?  

Two opposing views dominate the debate.  One camp argues that cash‑rich hyperscalers and sustained enterprise adoption will temper the swing, keeping AI valuations well below the extremes of the dot‑com era【Fidelity 2025】.  The other points to the concentration of AI spend in a handful of megacap players, soaring VC share and “irrational” hype – language reminiscent of the 2000 internet crash, echoed by Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai【BBC 2025】.  If AI‑driven revenue fails to match the **$500 bn‑$1 trn** of capex now being built, a **2026 correction** could resemble the dot‑com bust in magnitude, albeit with a larger underlying economic base.

**Bottom line:** AI has already become a material component of the global economy, contributing over **5 % of world GDP** and attracting unprecedented investment.  The sector’s rapid expansion, high valuations and concentration of capital create a genuine risk of a sharp pull‑back next year, but the depth of current adoption also suggests the possibility of a gradual deflation rather than a catastrophic pop.
