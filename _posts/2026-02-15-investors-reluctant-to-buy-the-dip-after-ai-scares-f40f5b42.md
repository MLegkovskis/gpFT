# Investors Reluctant to 'Buy the Dip' After AI Scares
The recent AI-related market fluctuations have led to a cautious approach among investors, with many demanding proof that massive AI-related capital expenditures translate into measurable revenue. 
## Revenue Expectations for Major Tech Companies
Investors expect double-digit revenue growth from the core cloud and advertising businesses of the hyperscalers, including Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. 
## Key Factors Influencing Investor Sentiment
* **AI-spending scrutiny**: Investors are scrutinizing AI spending and its impact on revenue growth
* **Higher cost of capital**: Interest rates above 5% are pressuring valuation multiples, prompting a 'wait-and-see' stance
* **Mixed early-stage monetization**: Consumer-facing AI has not yet delivered the revenue lift investors hoped for, leading to a cautious approach
