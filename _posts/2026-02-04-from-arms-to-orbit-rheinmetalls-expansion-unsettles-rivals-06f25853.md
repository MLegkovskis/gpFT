  - "Rheinmetall's expansion into five countries is projected to inject ≈ €1 bn of private capital and ≈ 3,200 jobs into the European defence-industrial base within three years."
  - "The annual value-added of ≈ €250 m translates into 0.05-0.12% GDP uplift for each host nation."
  - "The expansion deepens supply-chain localisation, reducing reliance on a single Canadian propellant plant and enhancing economic resilience."

Rheinmetall's expansion into orbit has significant implications for the company's financials and the broader economy. With a total announced capital spending of ≈ €1.0 billion, the expansion is expected to create ≈ 650 direct jobs and ≈ 2,500-3,000 indirect/induced jobs. The combined annual GDP contribution is estimated to be ≈ €252 million, which translates into a 0.05-0.12% GDP uplift for each host nation. The expansion also deepens supply-chain localisation, reducing reliance on a single Canadian propellant plant and enhancing economic resilience. Rheinmetall's coordinated rollout of high-tech munitions and propellant facilities across five countries is a significant development for the European defence-industrial base.
