### US Economy and Stock Market Performance
The current state of the US economy is being described as 'bad', but the stock market indices are not reflecting this narrative. As of January 18, 2026, the **S&P 500** is at **6,940.01**, down 0.06% for the day, but up **3.25%** for the month and **1.4%** year-to-date. The **Dow Jones Industrial Average** is at **49,359.33**, down 0.17% for the day, but up **2.7%** for the month and year-to-date. The **Nasdaq Composite** is at **23,515.39**, down 0.06% for the day, but up **1.2%** year-to-date.

The broad market is barely negative, with all three headline indices down less than 0.2% on the latest trading day. Monthly momentum is modestly positive, with the S&P 500 rising ~3% over the past 30 days. Year-to-date gains are small but positive, with the Dow up ≈2.7%, the S&P 500 up ≈1.4%, and the Nasdaq up ≈1.2%.

### Sector Rotation and Analyst Outlook
Sector rotation is underway, with financials and credit-sensitive stocks under pressure. Industrials, consumer discretionary, and health-care are being highlighted as 'healthier rotation' opportunities. Analysts, such as Angelo Kourkafas from Edward Jones, note that as long as economic resilience endures, the bull market is likely to continue, with healthier rotation in leadership helping to ease valuation concerns.

### Conclusion
The US stock market is absorbing the 'bad economy' narrative without a full-blown crash. While the small-cap Russell 2000 is vulnerable, reflecting tighter credit conditions, analyst commentary suggests confidence in underlying economic resilience.
